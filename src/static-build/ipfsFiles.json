It is the second biggest DEX on Ethereum and the third biggest protocol by TVL.\nThe CRV token is a governance token which also allows liquidity providers to boost their rewards on the platform as well as receive a share of trading fees on the Curve platform. Curve has recently reached over $10B in cumulative volume.\nUsers who vote lock their tokens (CRV => veCRV) receive a share of trading fees on the platform as well as a boost on their provided liquidity.\n\n## Motivation \nShort description of the proposed technical solution\n\n### Specifications \n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset? \n\nTeam member/llama master\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the collateral token \nSee Summary\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem: which market? \n\nThe asset will be listed in the current AAVE V2 market.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and how it overcame stressed conditions \n\nCurve was created in early 2020 and was the second protocol to reach $1B in TVL. It is currently the second biggest DEX on Ethereum.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used? \n\nLending/governance/profit sharing\n\n6.

Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github) \n\nLinks above\n\n8. Risk Assessment and Parameter suggestions \n\nHere is an analysis based on Aave’s Asset Risk Framework 3 to quantify CRV’s risks and the resulting model parameters suggestions\n\n## CRV’s Overall Risk is B-\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/1X/a381a8ece9bf0c2bba9b971856320c4d0e5815b4.png\" />\n</p>\n\nThe table below shows the key metrics used for the analysis as well as the risk scores using data from CoinGecko as of 15/12/2020\nCRV is the governance token of the Curve DAO behind the Curve Stablecoin Exchange the third biggest DEX on Ethereum with $1B of TVL. Curve offers an optimised model for stablecoin trading and revenue sharing incentives with fees from the >$10B in cumulative trading volume\n\n## CRV Smart Contract Risk: B-\nCRV token was introduced to Curve in August 2020 through liquidity mining. The code has 3 audits from ToB, Quantstamp and MixBytes. It is central in the DAO operations enabling stakers to vote and boost their yields with the locking of CRV. This model has generated half a billion transactions in half a year, with around 15,000 holders\n\n## CRV Counterparty Risk: B\nThe Curve DAO operates as a fully decentralised organisation with community proposals and votes. The ecosystem is funded by fees of the Curve Exchange generated by the $40m of daily volume\n\n## CRV Market Risk: C\nCurve is one of the leading DeFi projects. The token is available on top exchanges with nearly $100m market capitalisation and nearly as much average daily volume though a large share of CRV’s supply is locked. CRV experienced volatility in the last month with the rest of the market having yet to recover\nCRV’s risk profile is close to YFI’s leading to the same model parameters\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\n- LTV 40%\n- Liquidation Threshold 55%\n- Liquidation Bonus 15%\n- Reserve Factor 20%\n\n## Variable Interest Rate Model\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/chSyDxc.png\" />\n</p>\n\n\nCRV fits the profile of a collateral asset, with the need for a conservative borrow rate model with a low optimal utilisation to protect collateral liquidity\n\n- UOptimal 45%\n- R_0 0%\n- R_s1 7%\n- R_s2 300%\n\n### Code \nThe code is part of the standard Aave protocol deployment (the AToken, Debt tokens and interest rate strategy) therefore no audits are needed. The code can be found here https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/tree/master/contracts/protocol/tokenization\n\n### Test Cases \nBeing a standard ERC20, the Aave protocol test cases already cover everything needed to support CRV.\n\n### Security Considerations\nThe CRV token doesn’t have any specific behavior (eg. rebasing, balance increasing) and doesn’t offer meta governance functionalities since it requires locking to participate in the governance. Therefore, the standard AToken contract and corresponding debt tokens, already used for the majority of assets listed in Aave, can be also used for CRV. No auditing of the code is required.\n\n",

This is the suggested template for new AIPs. Note that an AIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your AIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `AIP-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->\n\n## Simple Summary\n<!--\"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.\" Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the AIP.-->\nThe Gemini dollar is a cryptographic token that is issued by Gemini, strictly pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, and built on the Ethereum network according to the ERC20 standard for tokens.\n\n\n## Abstract\n<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->\nAdd GUSD to the AAVE V2 market.\n\n## Motivation\n<!--The motivation is critical for AIPs that want to change Aave. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the AIP solves. AIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->\nGUSD is an additional fiat on-ramp into the DeFi ecosystem that will help diversify fiat sources inside of AAVE markets.\n\n## Specification\n<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->\nGUSD can be exchanged for USD at a fixed 1:1 rate on the Gemini exchange. I have personally tested this out and was impressed with the results: withdraw of GUSD from Gemini exchange was sent within 1 minute using fast gas, and deposit back into Gemini was credited within ~17 block confirmation. It should be possible for liquidators (who are willing/able to KYC) to flip GUSD collateral directly through Gemini for the time being. GUSD also has a few trading pairs on other centralized exchanges such as OKEx, HitBTC, and ZB. I plan on submitting a proposal to create a GUSD Curve pool in the near future as well, if this is supported by veCRV voters the on-chain liquidity for GUSD should improve substantially.\n\n## Rationale\n<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->\nBenefits for Aave:\n\nDiversification of centralized assets: GUSD relies on a different issuer and custodian compared to USDC, TUSD, USDT, or BUSD. Credit, custody, or regulatory risks may be less correlated across these assets, which could reduce risk to Aave security module stakers.\nNew DeFi on/off ramp: Gemini has good linkage with US bank wire and ACH networks, comparable to Coinbase as a fiat ramp.\nWhile Coinbase have played nice so far, it’s dominance in regulated crypto liquidity and USDC on/off ramp has huge influence over the space. I see Gemini and GUSD as a viable competitor. From an industrial economics standpoint, Aave and other Defi protocols like Maker may benefit from breaking down monopolies of their key counter-parties.\n\n<!-- ## Implementation -->\n<!--The implementations must be completed before any AIP is given status \"Implemented\", but it need not be completed before the AIP is \"Approved\". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of \"rough consensus and running code\" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->\n\n## Risk Analysis\n\nThe Risk Team has applied Aave’s Risk Framework to GUSD leading to an overall risk rating of B-\n\nGUSD is issued by Gemini Trust Company. It has been created for practical use in innovative applications, among which to facilitate Gemini’s institutional solutions and exchange operations.\n\nGUSD Smart contract Risk: C+\n\nGUSD was launched in September 2018 – at the same time then USDC – yet it has only experienced 120k blockchain transactions.\n\nThe GUSD smart contract only supports 2 decimals meaning that interest accrual can only occur for more than 1 cent.\n\nUSDC Counterparty Risk: C+ cannot use as collateral (centralisation D-)\n\nAs it is backed by real US dollars, GUSD is centralised. Moreover it has few holders with most of the transactions off-chain on the centralised Gemini environment.\n\nAn independent accountant’s audit report is published at the end of each month on the website. GUSD is regulated bringing trust to the token. Still, the infrastructure is based on the Ethereum blockchain where regulators have little power.\n\nGUSD Market Risk: B -\n\nGUSD has a small market capitalisation at less than 20m with a small trading volume. The price has diverged from 1 a few times in the last 3 months with up to 3% price variation.\nGiven the reduced market capitalization and the possibility of market price manipulation, the oracle will fix the price of GUSD to $1. This does not bring additional risk because the asset cannot be used as collateral and even if the market price swings considerably, the asset is still redeemable 1:1 for USD. The risk team will reevaluate the asset periodically to validate the viability of an actual market based oracle as the GUSD supply grows.  \n\nRisk Parameters ~ BUSD sUSD\nNot a collateral\nReserve Factor 10%\n\nVariable Interest Rate Model ~ BUSD sUSD\nUOptimal 80%\n\nR_0 0%\n\nR_s1 4%\n\nR_s2 100%\n\n## References\n\n- *Whitepaper*: https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-whitepaper.pdf\n- *Website*: https://gemini.com/dollar\n- *Twitter*: https://twitter.com/Gemini\n- *Source Code*: https://github.com/gemini/dollar\n- *GUSD token contract*: https://etherscan.io/token/0x056fd409e1d7a124bd7017459dfea2f387b6d5cd\n- *Accountant’s reports at bottom of page*: https://gemini.com/dollar#reports\n- *Trail of bits contract audit*: https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-trailofbits-audit.pdf\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

In the worst-case scenario of critical failure, an amount to be decided will be slashed from stakers deposits.\n\nIn this phase 0 of the slashing, the auction mechanism will not be automatized yet and if a slash were to happen it would be done through governance and direct compensation.\n\n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Increasing the Safety Incentives: As the possibility of slashing will now be formally introduced, staking reward should reflect the risk. Hence we propose to increase the Safety Incentives to 550 AAVE per day\n- Slashing %: The maximum slashing amount is set to 30%\n\n\n## Implementation details\n\nThe payload to be executed is available at\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4ab8ba929e4cc780cb82be34eea29a9ea7a58049#code\n\nThe payload will upgrade the Aave reserve contract to a new implementation\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xa335e2443b59d11337e9005c9af5bc31f8000714#code\n\nAnd introduce a reserve controller, with the rights of approving transfers/transferring assets out of the Aave Reserve, under control of the Aave governance short executor\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x1e506cbb6721b83b1549fa1558332381ffa61a93#code\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nBAL is the governance token of [Balancer](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/explore), a programmable liquidity and asset managment protocol with over [$800M in TVL](https://defipulse.com/balancer) according to DeFi Pulse.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAdd [BAL](https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d) to the AAVE V2 market.\n\nBalancer is a DEX that uses a constant function market maker formula to allow liquidity pools with multiple tokens, custom allocations and fees. Smart pools in Balancer can be used for programmable liquidity. \n\nTraders can swap between any of the tokens listed on Balancer in exchange for a swap fee (paid to liquidity providers) and slippage based upon the relative trade size. \n\nBAL is the governance token of the Balancer exchange, entitling holders (including those providing BAL liquidity on Balancer) to vote on proposals. BAL also receives preferential treatment in the Balancer exchange liquidity mining program.\n\nBalancer is responsible for the creation of [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/), and currently leading a number of [governance intiatives](https://snapshot.page/#/balancer/proposal/QmXQpKyw1BvYgZtvC2KGqrDezWBfSUBEKK77Kx866yBLYf) to reward active contributions to the protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs Balancer gears up for the launch of Balancer V2, composability becomes key for the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nAt the time of writing, BAL has a market cap of $230M.\n\nApart from the BAL liquidity on Balancer, BAL is also listed on FTX, Coinbase, Binance, Gemini and other centralized exchanges.\n\nAdding BAL to Aave will be the first major lending/borrowing market for the asset, and one that sets precedent for future exploration of Balancer Pool Token (BPT) markets similar to [Aave V1 Uniswap Markets](https://medium.com/aave/the-uniswap-market-is-live-on-aave-protocol-12b5a4cc5e2).\n\nAave leverages Balancer for it's [Safety Module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module), meaning this partnership further cements the relationship between the two protocols.\n\n*\"The advantage of using Balancer against other AMM solutions is clear when we factor in the possibility of dynamically adjusting the weighting towards AAVE. This allows for the creation of a market and the provision of liquidity whilst maintaining exposure to AAVE. Holding AAVE/ETH liquidity with uneven weights is very close to simply holding AAVE, with the benefits of earning trading fees on top of it.\"*\n\n\n## Benefits for Aave\nBalancer has an increasingly active community which would bring more users and liquidity to Aave.\n\nBAL earns native rewards through liquidity mining, currently yielding upwards of 80%+ APY with limited impermanent loss. This has generated strong borrowing demand for BAL on CREAM, with deposit rates often above 10%.\n\nWith deposit rates so high, it becomes super cost effective for people to borrow funds with BAL as collateral, often times with an effective negative borrowing rate!\n\n## Specification\nBAL will continue to see increased governance activity in the coming months.\n\nAdding BAL to the Aave V2 markets will provide strong borrowing demand, generating protocol fees and allowing for further governance participation.\n\n## Rationale\n\nBalancer and Aave are natural partners. Aave leverages Balancer for it's Safety Module and it only seems natural that BAL should be listed on Aave given the depth of the AAVE liquidity Balancer today.\n\nThis proposal opens design space for future lending use-cases, both on Balancer's end and on Aave's for more niche specific liqudity pool markets.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nWhitepaper - https://balancer.finance/whitepaper 1  \nWebsite - https://balancer.finance 1  \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/BalancerLabs  \nBlog - https://balancer.finance/blog-feed  \nDocumentation - https://docs.balancer.finance  \nSource Code - https://github.com/balancer-labs 2  \nBAL Token Contract - https://etherscan.io/address/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#code 1  \n\n\n## Audits/Security Reviews\n[Trail of Bits, Conesnsys Dilligence and Open Zeppelin.](https://docs.balancer.finance/core-concepts/security/audits)  \n\n[AAVE Community x BAL Risk Assesment](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-add-support-for-bal/1787/6?u=coopahtroopa)  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lrXmHFD.png)  \n\n**BAL Smart contract Risk: B-**\n\nSince it's launch in June BAL has reached half a million transactions driven by liquidity mining distribution program which may lead to inflation.

The contract of the ABPT can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41a08648c3766f9f9d85598ff102a08f4ef84f84).\n\nThis AIP, if accepted by the community, will start the Safety Incentive (SI) rewards distribution for ABPT stakers at the rate of 550 AAVE/day.

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\nxSUSHI is the governance token of Sushiswap, a community-led DEX with a current TVL of more than 1.1B.\n\n## Abstract\nAdd xSushi to the AAVE V2 market.\n\n## Motivation\nAave would be the first platform to support xSushi a yield bearing asset with over of 100m$ currently under utilized.\n\nAavengers could use their platform of predilection to borrow their existing xSushi.\n\nSupport community-led projects.\n\n## Specification\nxSushi is one of the two currently supported assets for Sushi governance (ETH/SUSHI SLP being the other one). We are currently not fully decentralized but the members of the Ops multisig and Treasury multisig are bound to respect all of the governance votes. We do plan to be a real DAO most likely leveraging Aragon v2 in 6 to 12 months depending on the progress made by community.\n\nxSushi is receiving 0.05% of all the swaps happening on Sushiswap and should also benefits from all of the future revenues streams from upcoming platforms such as Bento-Miso-Gusoku-Deriswap and more.\n\nThe current yield on this asset alone is hovering around 10-40% APY with over $100MM locked in the Sushibar making it an ideal productive asset as collateral.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe rationale for adding xSushi to the AAVE V2 market is simple; xSushi is a popular yield bearing asset but is currently incapable of being utilized for borrowing or lending.\n\nSUSHI can currently be borrowed and lent on [cream.finance](https://app.cream.finance/). However, xSushi cannot be borrowed or lent on any platform currently. By allowing xSushi to be borrowed and lent on AAVE v2, this will allow xSushi holders to access the liquidity of their platform\n\n\nThe rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->\n\n## Test Cases\n\n*see implementation*\n\n## Implementation\nAAVE does not use TWAP oracle and xSushi does not have sufficient liquidity on centralized exchanges we will calculate the xSushi using the existing oracle of SUSHI and applying a calculated exchange rate.\n\nThe price oracle for xSushi will calculate the price using a SUSHI price oracle multiplied by the exchange rate for SUSHI<>xSushi.\n\n`xSushiPrice = sushiPrice * exchangeRate`\n\nTo calculate the exchange rate we will check the SUSHI balance of the xSushi contract.\n\nAn example implementation of exchange rate calculation can be found below\n\n```js\nlet sushi = new ethers.Contract('0x6b3595068778dd592e39a122f4f5a5cf09c90fe2', abi, provider)\n\nlet totalSushiStakedinXSushi = await sushi.methods.balanceOf('0x8798249c2E607446EfB7Ad49eC89dD1865Ff4272').call()\n\nlet xSushi = new ethers.Contract('0x8798249c2E607446EfB7Ad49eC89dD1865Ff4272', abi, provider)\n\nlet totalXSushiSupply = await xSushi.methods.totalSupply().call()\n\nlet exchangeRate = totalSushiStakedinBar.div(totalXSushiSupply)\n```\n\nAt the request of the AAVE team we have included a convenience contract for returning the exchange rate of Sushi -> xSushi exchange rate.\n\n[Exchange Rate contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE8061286f2975EF38c8F70607eD839Fc9C0f0090#readContract)\n[Exchange Rate contract repo](https://github.com/sushiswap/xsushi-exchange-rate)\n\nValues from the `getExchangeRate()` method are returned as `uint256` values with a pecision of `10**18`\n\nLastly, xSushi is explicitly convertible for SUSHI at the exchange rate described above. Fees are paid as SUSHI to xSushi holders and collected into a pool of SUSHI, where each xSushi token represents a proportional share in the pool size. In essence SUSHI fees paid are accumulated to the xSushi which are not redeemable without the destruction of the underlying xSushi.\n\nSince debts incurred on AAVE would require that the debt be repaid in xSushi, the fees that are accumulated are safe from being harvested.\n\n\n## Audits/Security Reviews\n[Peckshield & Quantstamp](https://docs.defisafety.com/finished-reviews/sushiswap-process-quality-audit#audits)\n\n[**AAVE Community xSushi Risk Assement**](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-xsushi/1794/16)\n\n![Screenshot 2021-01-05 at 19.56.10](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/1X/e35ebb4c429ea6e1162d1fd6faf7d7b624287a14_2_690x184.png)\n\nSushiSwap is a DEX forked of Uniswap that grew very fast, now at $1.6B of TVL, thanks to generous liquidity mining incentives. It is now part of the Yearn conglomerate with many new upcoming features.\n\nxSUSHI is the staked SUSHI that receives .05% of the fees with 10 to 40% APY a great property for a collateral.

Shortly after launch, the key developer stole the development funds, eventually returning them. The network managed secure support from some industry leaders and has grown fast in these few month reaching two dozen users and over a billion transactions.\n\n**SUSHI Counterparty Risk: B**\n\nSushi is a permissionless blockchain protocol where token holders vote on incentives and upgrades.

      "description": "\n\n\n## Simple Summary\n\n\nAdd depositing and borrowing (not collateral) support for renFIL to the Aave market. renFIL is a wrapped version of [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) using [Ren Protocol](https://renproject.io/).\n\n## Abstract\n\n\n[Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) brings decentralized storage to DeFi, and [renFIL](https://renproject.io/) allows all types of new decentralized applications to be built to further the space. But these applications need a robust lending market to thrive, so storage miners can borrow renFIL/FIL to stake and FIL holders can earn a return on their holdings.\n\nThis proposal describes adding depositing and borrowing (not collateral) support for renFIL to the Aave market to unlock these new applications, expose the Filecoin community to Aave, and create a large new market on the protocol. [Ren Protocol](https://renproject.io/) was chosen as the tokenization service because it is already managing large bridges in production, including [$301 million in renBTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/renbtc) as of this writing. Collateral support for renFIL may be added later, but we recommend waiting for more price stability of FIL and renFIL before enabling.\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nFilecoin, and by extension, renFIL is unlike any other digital asset currently available in the Aave market, as it allows the purchase of hosting space on the permissionless Filecoin network. As a result, being able to lend and borrow renFIL will unlock many new DeFi applications, including:\n\n* Storage mining syndicates\n* Data markets\n* Shared UIs/images/content\n* Lossless capital hosting\n\nJust see the recent [EthGlobal<>Protocol Labs Hackathon](https://hack.ethglobal.co/hackfs/showcase) and [Filecoin Launchpad](https://www.filecoinlaunchpad.co/)for hints of what is possible at the intersection of Filecoin+DeFi. The Filecoin community is massive and growing everyday, however, many of the participants are unfamiliar with Aave and DeFi. Adding renFIL to Aave would dramatically increase support for these efforts, would bring Filecoin users/developers into the Aave ecosystem, and allow capital, yield, and value to accrue to Aave participants.\n\n## Specification\n\n\n### Project\nFilecoin is a distributed storage network based on a blockchain mechanism. Filecoin miners can elect to provide storage capacity for the network, and thereby earn units of the Filecoin cryptocurrency (FIL) by periodically producing cryptographic proofs that certify that they are providing the capacity specified. In addition, Filecoin enables parties to exchange FIL currency through transactions recorded in a shared ledger on the Filecoin blockchain. Rather than using Nakamoto-style proof of work to maintain consensus on the chain, however, Filecoin uses proof of storage itself: a miner’s power in the consensus protocol is proportional to the amount of storage it provides.\n\nFilecoin was founded in 2015 by [Juan Benet](https://twitter.com/juanbenet), has been backed by Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Union Square Ventures, and its mainnet went live on October 15, 2020. The network is governed by the Filecoin Foundation and the Filecoin Foundation for Decentralised Web.\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nThe REN token is already supported in the Aave market, and renBTC is one of the most popular cross-chain tokens today. In unifying the Filecoin and DeFi ecosystems, Ren protocol is a natural bridge and has the technical expertise and experience to get the job down securely and safely.\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\n\nThe Filecoin price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes both [FIL/ETH and FIL/USD feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nThe renFIL token will only be used for depositing and lending, not as collateral. The following strategy params are proposed:\n\n```\nIReserveParams = {\n  optimalUtilizationRate: new BigNumber(0.8).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n  baseVariableBorrowRate: '0',\n  variableRateSlope1: new BigNumber(0.07).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n  variableRateSlope2: new BigNumber(3).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n  stableRateSlope1: '0',\n  stableRateSlope2: '0',\n  baseLTVAsCollateral: '0',\n  liquidationThreshold: '0',\n  liquidationBonus: '0',\n  borrowingEnabled: true,\n  stableBorrowRateEnabled: false,\n  reserveDecimals: '18',\n  aTokenImpl: eContractid.AToken,\n  reserveFactor: '3500'\n};\n```\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n```\n    New interest bearing asset deployed on main:\n    Interest bearing aRENFIL address: 0x5CAF29fD8efbe4ED0cfc43A8a211B276E9889583\n    Variable Debt variableDebtRENFIL address: 0x4B20f007d0c1567Ca8a6e80B8a8EE19Ac59C6a08\n    Stable Debt stableDebtRENFIL address: 0xf22b80D58a7cCDEd772E0997AE90a6C77940B051\n    Strategy Implementation for RENFIL address: 0xb140cb1306B396c658A5438602b6857842E1E98a\n```\n\n### Test Cases\n\n\n## Audits/Security Reviews\n[Ren Protocol audits from ChainSecurity, ConsenSys Diligence, and Trail of Bits](https://github.com/renproject/ren/wiki/Audits)\n\n[Filecoin audits and bug bounty](https://security.filecoin.io/)\n\n[AAVE Community renFIL Risk Assement](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-add-support-for-renfil-filecoin/1059/17?u=corbpage)\n\n![renFIL Risk Screenshot](../assets/AIP-add_renFIL_support/renFIL_risk_screenshot.png)\n\n[**RenFIL Smart contract Risk**](https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd5147bc8e386d91cc5dbe72099dac6c9b99276f5): **C**\n\nRenVM is a byzantine fault-tolerant network that is able to securely in a decentralized manner do ECDSA threshold key generation and signing via sMPC, which allows RenVM to securely manage private keys of different assets like Bitcoin and Filecoin, and wrap these assets on smart-contract chains. Since launch, RenVM has processed around $1.5B in total volume of Bitcoin, Filecoin, Zcash, Bitcoin cash going to and from Ethereum. The smart contract risks of RenFIL are mitigated by those of RenBTC which has been battle tested by the markets.\n\nTechnically, renFIL is a proxied token standard ERC with some features on top:\n\n* Mechanism of exchange rate (similar to Aave slashing)\n* Permit for approvals\n* Recovery of other tokens sent to the contract\n\n**RenFIL Counterparty Risk: C**\n\nThere is a proxy admin which can update all the logic of the contract with a 7 days timelock controller by a multisig, controlled by the team. Even with 7 days, it may be impossible to mitigate the consequences of a contract upgrade with minting for example.\n\nFurthermore there is an EOA (Externally Owned Account) with permissions to mint, burn, change the exchange rate and decide which tokens sent by mistake to the renFIL contract are recoverable.\n\nThis results in the capability to burn tokens of a particular address (potentially the ones contained in aToken) and the change of the implementation under the proxy.\n\n[RenFIL Market 1](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/renfil): **Risk B (based on FIL)**\n\nRenFIL market capitalisation is unknown with very little liquidity in the markets. The redemption process is permissionless enabling smooth liquidations into the liquidity of FIL.\n\n**Risk Parameters**\n\nGiven the centralisation of RenFIL it can only be listed as borrow asset.\n\nReserve Factor 35%\n\n**Variable Interest Rate Model** \n\nUOptimal 80% (since not a collateral)\n\nR_0 0%\n\nR_s1 7%\n\nR_s2 300%\n\n![renFIL Interest Rate Model](../assets/AIP-add_renFIL_support/renFIL_risk_graph.png)\n\n## References\n* [Filecoin Website](https://filecoin.io/)\n* [Filecoin Spec](https://spec.filecoin.io/)\n* [Ren Protocol](https://renproject.io/)\n* [renFIL Token](https://etherscan.io/token/0xD5147bc8e386d91Cc5DBE72099DAC6C9b99276F5)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "basename": "AIP-16",
      "description": "\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe believe that a well designed LM program can accomplish the following:\n\nGrow lending and borrowing activity in targeted markets: With almost every major DeFi protocol launching a liquidity mining program, we believe it would be advantageous for Aave to utilize part of the Ecosystem Reserve to drive lending and borrowing activity across markets. Distributing AAVE to borrowers and lenders acts as an added incentive to attract more capital. The distribution can become more targeted over time. For example, certain markets may need more AAVE than others based on liquidity, utilization, and maturity of the market.\n\nBroader distribution and protocol decentralization: Rewarding AAVE to users of the protocol improves the distribution of the AAVE token. This gets AAVE into the hands of more users, further decentralizing the protocol.\n\nDeprecating Aave v1: Due to high gas fees and a lack of incentive to migrate, Aave v1 still contains approximately 40% of the value locked in the broader Aave protocol. By introducing liquidity mining rewards only on Aave v2, liquidity providers and borrowers will naturally migrate toward the optimized version. Declining liquidity on Aave v1 will facilitate a gradual deprecation of this iteration of the protocol, allowing more development activity to be directed at Aave v2.\n\nThis program is being proposed as a beta to further investigate how the inclusion of liquidity mining rewards will benefit the Aave ecosystem. From a supply perspective, this distribution results in only 5% of the fully diluted AAVE supply released each year. This enables Aave to experiment with liquidity mining rewards while saving the majority of the ecosystem reserves for other growth initiatives and grants. If this AIP passes, the Aave community can reflect on total supply/borrow and utilization by market to further refine the distribution program.\n\nThe forum [poll](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-introduce-liquidity-incentives-for-aave-v2/2340/27) closed with 62% of participants supportive of introducing rewards.\n\n## AIP rationale\n\n2,200 stkAAVE per day will be allocated pro-rata across supported markets based on the dollar value of the borrowing activity in the underlying market. While Aave has seen success without rewards so far, this program would attempt to supercharge its growth at a relatively low cost to the treasury and AAVE holders.\n\nThis distribution strategy rewards markets based on borrow demand. Markets with higher dollar value borrowed receive a higher share of the daily stkAAVE rewards. stkAAVE will be allocated at a 50/50 ratio between lenders and borrowers across stablecoin markets. In WBTC and ETH markets, the ratio between lenders and borrowers will be 95/5 to discourage riskier borrowing activity.\n\nstkAAVE will be rewarded instead of AAVE to align long-term incentives, disincentivize speculative farmers, and allow users to earn an underlying yield on top of the AAVE they earn. This helps align LPs by giving them more governance weight upfront and secure the protocol by increasing the amount of AAVE staked in the Safety Module. LPs then immediately earn a staking yield on their vested AAVE.\n\nstkAAVE requires a 10 day cooldown period. The cooldown period must be started before LPs can unstake their AAVE. After the cooldown period, users have a 2 day window to unstake.\n\nTo simplify the implementation and allow the community to analyze the distribution first, this proposal does not include a vesting component. As we approach the target end date for the LM program, we encourage the community to explore any vesting structures for stkAAVE.\n\nWe propose 7/15/21 as the target end date for this liquidity mining program. A mid-July end date gives the community 3 months of activity to analyze before voting to end, continue, or adjust the LM program.\n\n\n## AIP content in short\n\nThe purpose of this AIP is to introduce liquidity mining rewards for Aave v2.\n\nThis AIP would distribute 2,200 Staked AAVE (stkAAVE) per day, representing around 1M$ in rewards distributed daily to lenders and borrowers. Users will receive stkAAVE.\n\n2,200 stkAAVE per day will be allocated pro-rata across the following markets based on the dollar value of the borrowing activity in the underlying market:\n\n![Aave](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aave/aip/Pending-AIPs/content/assets/AIP-16/aip16-img.png)\n\n\n$ Value as of 3/22/21\n\nThis program is structured as a beta, with the opportunity to track protocol activity and refine the distribution in the future.\n\nThe distribution has a target end date of 7/15/21. The community will be able to review the results of the LM program and adjust any parameters accordingly.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDistribute 2,200 stkAAVE daily from the [Ecosystem Reserve](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/incentives-policy-and-aave-reserve) to borrowers and lenders\n\nEcosystem Reserve contract : https://etherscan.io/address/0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491#code\n\n## Implementations details\n\nProposal contract:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x5778DAee2a634acd303dC9dC91e58D57C8FFfcC8#code\n\nThe proposal will update the aDAI/GUSD/USDC/USDT/WBTC/WETH implementations and the variableDebt DAI/GUSD/USDC/USDT/WBTC/WETH implementation to set the Incentives controller to https://etherscan.io/address/0x5778DAee2a634acd303dC9dC91e58D57C8FFfcC8.

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nIntroduce the Aave Grants DAO (AGD) to fund ideas submitted by the Aave community.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe propose starting a community-led grants DAO to fund ideas submitted by the Aave community, with a focus on empowering a wider network of community developers. The pilot program will be over two quarters. The grants budget will be $1 million per quarter and the operating budget will be $250,000 over two quarters. The operating budget will be used to pay the lead, reviewers, lawyer, and other administrative costs to set up the grants program. A committee of 8 members, including one lead, will oversee the grants program. \n\nIf this AIP is approved, 2,809 AAVE ($1.25 million) will be transferred from the [Ecosystem Reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491) to the [grants DAO multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x89C51828427F70D77875C6747759fB17Ba10Ceb0/balances). The remaining $1 million will be funded in the beginning of the second quarter of the grants program.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave has an ecosystem reserve of $1.2B or 2.7m AAVE as of 4/27/21, which is available to fund growth and community initiatives, part of which could be used to fund grants. However, it is currently not easy for the community to allocate from the reserve to fund proposals.\n\nTo promote inclusivity and a more visible and transparent avenue for funding development in the Aave ecosystem, while maintaining the decentralized nature of the ecosystem, we propose a community-led grants program called Aave Grants DAO.\n\nThe goal of the program is to provide resources to grow the Aave ecosystem in a way that can scale over time. There are many great ideas for improving the Aave protocol bubbling up in the Discord, community forum and other places. We hope to initiate a community-led, transparent process for connecting those developers/creators/innovators with resources needed to go from idea to funded development.\n\nGiven the difficulty of decentralizing grants administration, we propose establishing a committee which has the power to administer grants on a discretionary basis. The focus will be on disbursing grant funding effectively and quickly to individuals and teams working to improve the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## Rationale\n\nOur proposal is inspired by the grants programs of Compound and Uniswap, which have both received approvals to deploy $1m and $750k per quarter, respectively.\n\nWe propose to run the pilot grants program over two quarters. We request a max grants budget of $2m and a max operating budget of $250k. The operating budget will be used to pay the lead, reviewers, lawyer, and other administrative costs to set up the grants program.\n\nThere will be two types of grants that the grants committee can approve:\n1. Rapid grants: < $100k, simple process to apply for a grant to AGD, relatively quick grant decision\n2. Community grants: $100k-$500k, initial application followed by posting proposal on governance forum, committee can decide to approve these grants based on feedback from community\n\nContributors can also seek grants over $500k but they will not go through the committee. They will have to be posted on Aave’s governance forum and approved through an on-chain vote.\n\nThe expenses will be priced in USD terms at the beginning of each quarter. The reviewers will ensure that all unspent funds will be returned to the Ecosystem Reserve at the conclusion of the pilot. If the program is underfunded because AAVE’s token price falls significantly, the committee may request the underfunded amount from governance. After running the pilot program for two quarters, the community can vote to continue, modify, or discontinue the program.\n\nApplications will be reviewed and funded on a rolling basis. The applications approved and funded within each quarter will form a funding round which will be tracked, supported and documented.\n\nDocumentation of results will be made available to the community at the end of each round, at which point we will solicit feedback from the community. The idea is to start with a rough MVP and evolve through community feedback. We expect to learn a lot about how to do this right in the first 2 quarters and anticipate making changes to the grants program over time through subsequent proposals.\n\n## Committee Members\n\nWe propose a committee of 8 members: 1 lead and 7 reviewers. The lead will be the organizational backbone of the program and ensure that things move smoothly and efficiently. The lead will likely dedicate a significant amount of time to the program.\n\nReviewers will process applications, ensure that the lead is acting in good faith and is effective in their role, and will operate a 4 of 7 multisig which disburses funds to grantees. The reviewers will also hold the program accountable to its goals and objectives and return any excess funds to the Aave Ecosystem Reserve. Reviewers are likely to dedicate a smaller amount of time to the program.\n\nBoth the lead and the reviewers will serve for a period of two quarters. After two quarters, the grants program and the committee member positions will be up for renewal. This will be put up on the governance forum for a discussion and subsequent on-chain vote.\n\nMembers may be replaced during the pilot program, for example, if they find they are not able to dedicate sufficient time to the program. We aim to be as transparent as possible and get feedback on the Aave forum if there are any changes to the committee during the program.\n\nThe committee is composed as follows:\n\nLead: [Shreyas Hariharan](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas) - Llama\n\nShreyas is the founder of Llama, which helps DeFi protocols and DAOs manage their treasury. He has actively worked on treasury spending, allocation, and reporting. He is working on a treasury strategy for Uniswap and serving as a reviewer for Uniswap grants. As an Aave community member and token holder, he is excited to help grow the Aave ecosystem through the grants program.\n\nReviewers:\n\n1. [Aleks Larsen](https://twitter.com/_alekslarsen) - Blockchain Capital\n2. [Jose Maria Macedo](https://twitter.com/ZeMariaMacedo) - Delphi Digital\n3. [Imran Khan](https://twitter.com/lmrankhan) - DeFi Alliance\n4. [Maggie Love](https://twitter.com/melove_07) - W3BCLOUD and SheFi\n5. [Corbin Page](https://twitter.com/corbpage) - ConsenSys Codefi\n6. [Nick Cannon](https://twitter.com/inkymaze) - Gauntlet\n7. [Calvin Chu](https://twitter.com/calchulus) - Independent\n\n## Budget\n\nWe request a max grants budget of $2m to distribute grants and a max operating budget of $250k over two quarters to pay the lead, reviewers, lawyer, and other administrative costs to set up the grants program. This will be funded by the Aave Ecosystem Reserve.\n\nPayments to the lead will be approved by the reviewers and made at the end of every month (i.e., if the program begins on 4/30/21, the lead will be paid on 5/30/21, and the again on 6/30/21 and 7/30/21 based on hours worked). Payments to reviewers will also be made every month based on hours worked.\n\nAny changes to the AGD including renewal of the program at the end of 2 quarters, total quarterly budget and committee compensation will require full quorum.\n\n## Committee Compensation\n\nWe suggest compensation for the lead roughly in line with the initial Uniswap and Compound proposals - $100/hr for a maximum of 40 hrs/week. This compensation will be allocated to the AGD multisig from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve as part of the overall funding for the program.\n\nThe time commitment for the reviewers is likely to be far lower. The compensation for reviewers will be $100/hr for a maximum of 5 hrs/week.\n\n## Priorities\n\nTo help inform the types of grants which are most likely to get funded, we highlight the following target areas:\n\n1. Protocol development (including core Aave protocol development, development of higher layer protocols which use the Aave protocol)\n2. Applications and integrations (front-ends and other applications that use the Aave protocol)\n3. Developer tooling\n4. Community (marketing and educational)\n5. Committees, sub-committees, and DAOs that serve the Aave ecosystem\n6. Code audits\n7. Events and hackathons\n8. Bounties\n\n## What does success look like?\n\nWe will evaluate the success of the program against the following criteria:\n\nMeasurable criteria:\n\n1. Growth in the number of grants applications received quarter-over-quarter\n2. Growth in the number of projects, ideas, and events funded\n3. Growth in community engagement (e.g. increased activity on forums, Discord, etc.)\n4. Growth in Aave pools driven by applications funded via grants (e.g. increased TVL, borrow activity, and unique addresses due to apps funded by grants)\n\nSubjective criteria:\n\n1. Improved sentiment and goodwill within the community\n2. Improvement to the Aave protocol’s brand and positioning in the market\n\n## Timeline / Process\n\nWe will organize grant recipients into two 3-month funding rounds. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis and any grants disbursed during a given 3-month period become part of the corresponding round. Round 1 will be for three months from the day the grants proposal has been approved. For example, if the proposal is approved on 4/30/2021, Round 1 of the grants program will be from 4/30/2021 to 7/30/2021 and Round 2 of the grants program will be from 7/30/2021 to 10/30/2021.\n\nIf approved, starting immediately after a proposal is ratified, AGD will begin accepting applications on a rolling basis. The grants committee will determine on how funding is to be disbursed (e.g. milestones, upfront, etc.) on a case-by-case basis. In general, the goal will be to align long-term incentives with the interests of the Aave community and AAVE holders.\n\nAt the end of each round, the committee is responsible for sharing all the grant recipients along with amounts and descriptions as part of a transparent quarterly review process. The end of the Round 2 marks the end of the pilot. At that point, the community will decide based on the results of the first two rounds whether or not to continue funding AGD (in the same or an amended form).\n\nMost grants will have 1-2 milestones and recipients will receive about half the grant upfront and half on the completion of a milestone. For more complex projects or larger grants, there may be several milestones and payments could be split across these milestones. AGD will get progress updates from teams and assess the completion of these milestones. This ensures downside protection for the AGD in case the project is unsuccessful or needs to pivot.\n\nThe grants will primarily be focused on projects working to improve the Aave protocol. However, a small portion of the budget (5-10%) may be allocated to select projects with a wider scope (e.g. ETH scalability).\n\nIf AGD has distributed all grants but has more promising projects to fund, it can propose increasing the budget to governance. However, it is entirely up to the Aave community to vote on whether to increase the budget.\n\n## Implementation\n\nIf this AIP is approved, 2,809 AAVE ($1.25 million) will be transferred from the [Ecosystem Reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491) to the [grants committee multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x89C51828427F70D77875C6747759fB17Ba10Ceb0/balances). $1 million will fund the first quarter of Aave grants and $250,000 will cover two quarters of operating expenses for the program. The remaining $1 million will be funded in the beginning of the second quarter of the grants program.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nReflexer Labs has designed a new type of stable asset called RAI, an ETH backed stablecoin with a moving peg. RAI aims to become an autonomous, crypto native and stable unit of account for the DeFi industry.\n\n## Abstract\n\nRAI is an asset backed only by ETH, governance-minimized, and programmed to maintain its own price stability without needing to peg to an external price reference like the USD. We believe these qualities make RAI ideal initially as an alternative to pegged-coins for use in DeFi as collateral and as a stable reserve asset, especially for programs where resilience is critical.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIntroducing more trustless, stable assets into Aave money markets will benefit both Aave and the ecosystem as a whole. The addition of RAI will diversify the protocol’s exposure to stable assets beyond traditional dollar-pegged stablecoins and provide enough bandwidth to grow the protocols TVL.\n\nCurrently, more than $4.56B worth of stable asset liquidity on Aave V1 and V2 is centralised (USDC, USDT, TUSD, BUSD, GUSD) while only $1.25B (~25%) is decentralised (DAI, sUSD). While this isn’t inherently a negative, introducing more decentralised, stable assets adds to Aave’s composability and resilience.\n\nRAI also stands to benefit from being able to expand its utility and liquidity across the largest lending protocol in the space, allowing for more experimentation to occur in the ongoing journey towards entirely trustless and decentralized stable-credit.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nCo-founder of Reflexer.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nRAI is a decentralized non-pegged ETH-back stable asset meant to act as pristine collateral in DeFi.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nOther stablecoins are either centralized or pegged to the dollar. RAI is neither of those and aligns perfectly with the ethos of trust-minimized finance.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nRAI launched in February and has amassed over $100M in liquidity with $300M in value locked. RAI is governance minimised by design, as well as currently moving towards a grants DAO.\n\n5.How is the asset currently used?\n\nRAI is currently used as a trust-minmized alternative to other stablecoins. The goal is to drive adoption of RAI to be used as collateral in money markets, other synthetic assets, and more.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule. Similar to DAI, RAI minted on demand when users lock ETH into the protocol.\n\n7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n\nRight now the protocol is almost fully upgradeable. This includes anything from oracles, the contract that collects stability fees, the contract that liquidates positions, the one that auctions collateral etc. This is managed through a multisig with a 6 hour delay on any governance action. Managed by the Reflexer core team. The multisig manages the full system and will do so until rai is gov minimized.\n\nOn the other hand, the contract that keeps track of debt and collateral in all Safes (CDPs) cannot be upgraded.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n    Market Cap: $67M\n    24h Volume: $8M\n    Volatility: Very Low\n    Maturity: Early-Mid\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\n10K followers on Twitter, 4.7K members on Discord, Github is highly active.\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\n    Date of Deployment: February 13th, 2021\n    Number of Transactions: 40,000+\n    Number of Holders: 2,000+\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe decision to design RAI as it is today came from the desire to achieve three main goals.\n\n1. DeFi Lego\n\n- Fork of MakerDAO’s Multi-Collateral DAI (MCD)\n- Governance-minimized in the Long Run\n- Algorithmic (PI controller) interest rates\n\n2. Self-stabilizing asset-backed credit facility\n\n- Like MakerDAO, users can unlock credit from their ETH\n- Unlike MakerDAO, debt/credit is not fixed at $1. Rather, it fluctuates based on supply and demand\n- RAI’s PI controller updates the system’s moving peg to balance demand for debt vs. credit\n\n3. Reserve asset for DeFi, alternative to pegged coins\n\n- More decentralized than dollar coins like USDC & USDT\n- Independent of USD inflationary monetary policy\n- Avoids being targeted by dollar coin regulation like the “Stable Act”\n- Backed by pure ETH, no centralized collateral\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe RAI price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [RAI/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nRAI will only be used for depositing and lending, not as collateral. The following params are proposed:\n\n\n  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo\n  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n  - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n  - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n  - Borrowing Enabled: true\n  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n  - Reserve Decimals: 18\n  - Reserve Factor: 2000\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n- Interest bearing aRAI: 0xe0065ea37791d336D78fcA0e870D04f700395B8d\n- Variable Debt variableDebtRAI: 0x2cDA07B4a6D9064292DD8d624883f07c27eE01B7\n- Stable Debt stableDebtRAI: 0xf37E202E587c6f63FD70F35C24Eb7f818CC5d01A\n- Strategy Implementation for RAI: 0xA7d4df837926cD55036175AfeF38395d56A64c22\n\n\n## Audits/Security Reviews\n\n[OpenZeppelin Audit for the Core Contracts](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-audits/tree/master/open-zeppelin/core-contracts)\n\n[Quantstamp Audits for Periphery Contracts](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-audits/tree/master/quantstamp/helper-contracts)\n\n[Solidified Audit for Periphery Contracts](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-audits/tree/master/solidified/helper-contracts)\n\n**RAI Smart Contract Risk**: **C-**\n\nRAI has been on Mainnet Ethereum for a bit more than 100 days.\n\n**RAI Counterparty Risk**: **C-**\n\nCurrently the RAI protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig. The protocol is meant to be governance minimized by end of summer 2022 according to [this public roadmap](https://docs.reflexer.finance/ungovernance/governance-minimization-guide#4-governance-minimization-levels).\n\nRAI currently has 2,063 holders who performed more than 50,000 transfers.\n\n**RAI Market Risk**: **C**\n\nThe current RAI market cap is 33,126,214 USD. The average 24H trading volume in the past month has been 8,786,384,63 USD. RAI's normalized volatility over the last month is 1.49%.\n\n## References\n\nWhitepaper - https://github.com/reflexer-labs/whitepapers/blob/master/English/rai-english.pdf\n\nWebsite - https://reflexer.finance/\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/reflexerfinance\n\nDocs - https://docs.reflexer.finance/\n\nGithub - https://github.com/reflexer-labs\n\nToken Contract - https://etherscan.io/token/0x03ab458634910aad20ef5f1c8ee96f1d6ac54919\n\n## Test Cases\n\n## Implementation\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

It is an uncollateralized financial primitive with an elastic supply that adjusts each day according to demand in the marketplace. Ample targets the 2019 USD. Like Bitcoin, Ample is non-dilutive but it has a long-term unit of account that unlocks safe denomination of debt. The goal of Ampleforth is to create a building block for a safer, more resilient financial ecosystem.\n\nBeing able to borrow and lend AMPL would enable holders to:\n\n- Utilize a new, low-correlated collateral asset which could reduce risk\n- Decrease exposure to rebases in exchange for income from interest\n- Use a non-collateralized asset that “[borrows like a stablecoin](https://medium.com/ampleforth/elastic-finance-lending-213e02de0583)\"\n- Create leveraged AMPL trades and unlock derivatives\n- Create interest bearing AMPL that can be staked in other protocols\n- Increase exposure to AMPL & farming\n\n## Motivation\nAMPL total supply and balances change once every 24 hours (at 2am UTC) based on market price. The supply change factor is the same for all holders. Because of that, lending and borrowing AMPL behaves differently from fixed supply tokens.\n\nThe desired behavior is for the borrow amount (loan) to stay the same after a rebase. The unborrowed tokens deposited in the Aave protocol still get exposed to rebase just like any other contract wallet. This means aAMPLs \"partially rebase\", in accordance with the utilization ratio.\n\nThe AMPL AToken functionally behaves similarly to every other AToken. It maintains a 1:1 peg with the underlying AMPL.\n\n### Specifications\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nCo-founder, developer\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the collateral token\nSee Summary\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem: which market?\n\nThe asset will be listed in the current AAVE V2 market.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and how it overcame stressed conditions\n\nAmpleforth launched in July, 2019. Since then, Ample has executed over 550 days of rebases. The network was subject to extreme growth and volatility following the launch of the Geyser liquidity mining program in July 2020. It has shown resilience with a lifetime median price of $1.00 and average price of $1.02 (vs target price of $1.02). There are currently over 22K holders and is a top 100 currency by Market Cap.\n\nOnchain network history viewable on [Dashboard](https://www.ampleforth.org/dashboard/).\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\nAmple aims to be a financial building block that supports a robust and stable financial ecosystem. Borrowing and lending is a critical layer of this stack. [Current roadmap](https://www.ampleforth.org/roadmap/).\n\n6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nAmple has developed deep liquidity on AMMs like Uniswap, SushiSwap, Mooniswap, and a Smart Pool on Balancer through its liquidity mining program.\n\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ampleforth#markets\n\n7. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nLinks above\n\n8. Risk Assessment and Parameter suggestions\n\nAMPL has been evaluated as low technical risk because it doesn't have any potential of infinite or uncontrolled minting.\n\nGiven the novel mechanism of rebasing, it will only be used as a borrowing currency for the time being. An evalution of whether to give it collateral status will be performed afterward.\n\nA 3rd party Audit report from Peckshield can be found [here](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/50290685aa3b68eea18f4a908748aafb05db96ab/audits/PeckShield-Audit-Report-aAMPL-v1.0.pdf).\n\nAfter some recommendations from Aave devs, we made small updates to the implementation. This included no behavioral changes but included using a different math library and method of initializating configuration. We then ran a second round of audits with Peckshield that raised no new issues.\n\nInternal testing was performed with a mainnet fork.\n\nWe launched an [Immunefi Bug Bounty](https://immunefi.com/bounty/ampleforth/) for the aToken with a competitive $100K reward for critical vulnerabilities. This has also raised no issues.\n\n### Technical Specifications\n\nWe implement a custom AToken, StableDebtToken and VariableDebtToken for AMPL. The StableDebtToken and VariableDebtToken implementations make no functional changes to the generic implementation. When the debt tokens are minted and burned, it performs some additional book-keeping to keep track of the totalScaledAMPL (fixed AMPL denomination, ie Gons) borrowed at any-time. The new getAMPLBorrowData method returns the totalScaledAMPL and totalScaledSupply which are used for AAmplToken math.\n\nGeneric AToken has a private balance and public balance. The public balance returned by balanceOf is multiplied by an interest rate factor. The aAMPL works the same way but the AAmplInternal balance is multiplied by another factor, which accounts for the underlying AMPL rebasing and the amount of AMPL unborrowed.\n\n### Code\nAAMPL token address: 0x6fBC3BE5ee5273598d1491D41bB45F6d05a7541A\nCode verified [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6fBC3BE5ee5273598d1491D41bB45F6d05a7541A#code)\n\nSteps the proposal will execute:\n1. Start a vote to add aAMPL as a new asset.\n\n### Test Cases\n- [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a4zd7UL-U5Xrme9b0X5B39nJzjrFwfG1?usp=sharing) of test cases\n- Unit tests included with code change provide full coverage for all borrow, repay, and rebase flows.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- Standard technical risks of smart contracts apply to the AToken implementation.\n- Market risk resulting from first borrow/lending market for a rebasing currency.\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP is to list PAX for lend/borrow support on Aave.  Paxos Standard (PAX) is one of largest regulated USD-backed stablecoins, and listing on Aave will provide users a highly trustworthy crypto asset to lend and borrow. PAX is issued by a NYDFS regulated financial institution - Paxos Trust Company - and the token itself is also regulated by NYDFS. This oversight ensures PAX is 100% backed by US Dollars or short term government securities (e.g. “t-bills”) at all times (attestations). PAX users are assured to always access their dollars - all PAX reserves are held fully segregated and bankruptcy remote in US bank accounts, which only Paxos-issued tokens can claim. PAX is also the only coin to have received a successful SOC-II audit. We think transparency is a hallmark of DEFI, and PAX’s transparency and trustworthiness will be beneficial for the community. We are excited at the prospect of listing PAX on Aave.\n\n## Abstract\n\nPaxos Standard (PAX) was launched in 2018 and is a USD stablecoin that is 100% backed by US dollars or short term government securities held bankruptcy remote. Paxos issues PAX, and both the company and token are regulated by the NY DFS. Full PAX attestations are completed monthly and posted to www.paxos.com/attestations.\n\nPAX is used in a variety of use cases including as a means of payment for other blockchain-based assets, a trustworthy store-of-value, settlement outside of traditional banking hours, and being lent / borrowed on known CeFi institutions like BlockFi and Celsius. PAX is included in MakerDAO’s pool and is available for trading on DeFi Apps, including Curve and Uniswap. Paxos would like to extend PAX’s functionality through inclusion in Aave’s lend/borrow markets.  Collateral support could be proposed in future AIPs.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nPaxos would like to extend PAX’s functionality in the DeFi space through a listing on Aave. We believe adding PAX will provide users a highly trustworthy crypto asset to lend and borrow. PAX is valuable not only due to its transparency and trustworthiness, but also the range of use cases it supports, including store-of-value, settlement, trading, and peer-to-peer transfer.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nSoftware Engineer employed at Paxos. Paxos Trust Company is a qualified custodian and trust company regulated by NY DFS and is the sole issuer of the PAX token.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nPAX is the most secure, highest regulated stablecoin available. Token was launched in 2018 to facilitate many blockchain-based use-cases such as payments and stable digital storage.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nPAX is valuable to borrow due to its trustworthiness and range of use cases including store of value, settlement, trading, and peer to peer transfer. PAX is also very liquid and can be created and redeemed directly through Paxos, or can be used to trade on CeFi and DeFi exchanges. Paxos additionally plans to request collateral status at a future date.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nPAX was launched on September 10th, 2018. PAX is included in MakerDAO’s pool and is available for trading on DeFi Apps Curve and Uniswap, as well as traded on many different centralized exchanges.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\nPAX shares the typical use-cases for USD stablecoins.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nPAX tokens are minted/burned based on client demand. The process for minting and burning has been approved by the NYDFS and is regularly audited by a third party. Full monthly attestations are available on the Paxos website. Market cap fluctuates as users purchase and redeem PAX.\n\n7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n   \n   *All of the following roles are held by multi-sig addresses.*\n   1. Controlling the token supply - The supplyController address can mint and burn the token based on the actual movement of USD in and out of the reserve based on requests for the purchase, conversion and redemption of PAX.\n   2. Contract Owner - Can pause/unpause the contract and propose a new owner.\n   3. Asset Protection Role - As required by our regulators, we have introduced a role for asset protection to freeze or seize the assets of a criminal party when required to do so by law, including by court order or other legal process.\n   4. Upgradeability Proxy - To facilitate upgradeability on the immutable blockchain we follow a standard two-contract delegation pattern: a proxy contract represents the token, while all calls not involving upgrading the contract are delegated to an implementation contract. The proxy used here is AdminUpgradeabilityProxy from ZeppelinOS.\n   \n\n8.

This extension should give the community enough time to [debate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-extend-aave-liquidity-mining-rewards/4852/15) any changes to the liquidity mining program without any interruption for Aave borrowers and lenders.\n\nThe same stkAAVE distribution will be used.\n\n**Liquidity Mining v1**\n\nLiquidity mining incentives were introduced for Aave v2 on 4/26/21.\n\n2,200 stkAAVE per day will be allocated pro-rata across supported markets based on the dollar value of the borrowing activity in the underlying market. stkAAVE was distributed over AAVE to further align users with the Aave Protocol and increase the amount of AAVE staked in the safety module.\n\n**Liquidity Mining Recap**\n\n-   Value Distributed: During the liquidity mining campaign, 198,000 stkAAVE will be distributed to borrowers and lenders on Aave v2, using ~7% of the Ecosystem Reserve. This equates to $82MM in rewards (AAVE VWAP since LM program started).\n\n-   TVL: v2 TVL rose from $7.8 billion to a high of $14.4 billion in mid-May. Stablecoin liquidity accounts for more than 60% of total Aave v2 liquidity.\n\n-   V1 to V2 liquidity migration: v1 liquidity decreased from $2.5 billion to $372MM since the liquidity mining program started. 40% of Aave liquidity was deployed in v1 before the LM rewards started. Aave v1 liquidity now accounts for less than 3% of all liquidity on Aave. This allows the community to remain focused on v2 and upcoming money markets.\n\n-   Growth in dollar value supplied and borrowed: The USDC and DAI markets experienced the largest increase in dollar value supplied and borrowed. Note - many users on these markets have recursively levered their position to maximize yields. Recursive leverage accounts for ~32% of all deposits on v2. This compares to ~40% on Aave’s Polygon market.\n\n-   Reserve Growth: Aave reserves help provide the first layer of protection for borrowers and lenders. Since liquidity mining rewards launched, Aave’s v2 reserves have grown by [~$7MM](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c).\n",

      "basename": "AIP-23",
      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nWe are proposing to add BarnBridge (BOND) to Aave as collateral.\n\n## Abstract\n\nBarnBridge is building a suite of applications that allows users to mitigate risk across various use cases throughout DeFi. These applications rely on differentiated user profiles, referred to as tranches, in order to create markets for risks such as interest rate fluctuations and asset price volatility. Currently, SMART Yield on Ethereum mainnet has some $290M in TVL, while SMART Exposure and SMART Alpha are slated for Q3 of 2021. The BOND token is used to govern the BarnBridge DAO and allocate protocol resources.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBarnBridge is one of a handful of DAOs noted for its sizable allocation of its own native asset (see: open-orgs.info). It currently holds over 30% of the total BOND supply.\n\nAdding BOND to Aave would provide a mechanism through which the DAO could finance growth, decreasing the need for excessive token distributions. Example use cases include: funding projects building on top of BarnBridge applications, paying salaries to key protocol participants, and hosting bug bounties that earn yield until paid out.\n\nBarnBridge earns fee revenues from both deposits of underlying assets and redemptions of derivative assets. By adding BOND as collateral, the DAO and individual BOND holders can borrow against their position, increasing stablecoin demand and utilization on Aave v2. Additionally, BOND holders can lend out their position for a yield on Aave v2. Given BarnBridge’s direct role as an Aave liquidity provider, the addition of BOND to Aave v2 creates more synergies between Aave and BOND holders.\n\nTo start, it may make sense for BOND to have a conservative LTV and liquidation threshold which can be fine tuned further down the line.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n  \n  - Seed investor in BarnBridge\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n  \n  - BarnBridge is a risk tokenizing protocol. It aims to reduce the risks associated with DeFi, such as inflation risk, market price risk, and cash-flow volatility   risk. By letting users select a risk profile, BarnBridge can redistribute risk via tokenized, liquid tranches. BarnBridge does this with its SMART Yield, SMART   Exposure, and SMART Alpha products, all of which address a specific DeFi risk category.\n\n  - BOND token is a governance token that powers the BarnBridge DAO protocol. BOND is an ERC-20 token. Token holders have the ability to govern the network by       staking their holdings in return for the right to participate in on-chain voting and make decisions on the protocol development.\n\n  - BOND total supply: 10,000,000 (minting function is disabled).\n  - Token contract address: [`0x0391D2021f89DC339F60Fff84546EA23E337750f`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0391D2021f89DC339F60Fff84546EA23E337750f)\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the Aave ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n  \n  - By adding BOND as collateral, the DAO and individual BOND holders can borrow against their position, increasing stablecoin demand and utilization on Aave v2. Additionally, BOND holders can lend out their position for a yield on Aave v2. Given BarnBridge’s direct role as an Aave liquidity provider, the addition of BOND to Aave v2 creates more synergies between Aave and BOND holders. BarnBridge currently provides ~$180M in liquidity to Aave v2 and will be launching a similar integration on Polygon in July.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n  \n  - BarnBridge was founded in September 2020. Since that time, BarnBridge succeed in launching the BarnBridge DAO and delivering a SMART Yield product which currently holds $280M+ in TVL with $178M providing to Aave. With the upcoming SMART Yield and SMART Exposure launch on Polygon, followed by the product we call SMART Secret and SMART Alpha (later) BarnBridge will be a full-established protocol with plenty of products and potentially with 1B+ in TVL after all our products launch.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n  \n  - BOND token is currently used for:\n\n     - Staking in BarnBridge DAO to get exposure to voting rights in the DAO.\n     - Liquidity providing on Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Bancor.\n     - Lending on Cream finance.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n  \n  ![BarnBridge BOND emission schedule](../assets/AIP-23/emission.png)\n\n7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradeability\n  \n  - Protocol is upgraded by the BarnBridge DAO.  We used the Diamond Standard on a couple parts of the protocol so we could do seamless upgrades.  A users token \"power\" determines their vote weight and control they have in the DAO.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n  \n  - Market cap: $96M\n  - 24h Volume: $5.7M\n  - Volatility: high\n  - Exchanges: Coinbase, Uniswap, Bancor, Gemini\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n  \n  - Twitter: 19.4K\n  - Discord: 6.2K\n  - Medium: 4.1K\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n  \n  - Transactions: 116K\n  - Token holders: 6.3k\n\n## Rationale\n\nBarnBridge will continue to grow as a distributor of Aave v2 stablecoin markets as its SMART Yield integration gains further traction. There are currently ~$180M worth of stablecoins deposited into Aave v2 through SMART Yield. This liquidity is provided without any expectation of being used, meaning BarnBridge is a pure liquidity provider for Aave. BarnBridge is also actively building an integration with Aave’s Polygon market. Future BarnBridge products, including SMART Alpha senior tranches for assets like wBTC and ETH, stand to provide Aave with relatively safer collateral given their ability to mitigate price drawdowns. \n\n## Test Cases\n\nTest cases for an implementation are mandatory for AIPs but can be included with the implementation.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Contracts\n\n- Interest bearing aBOND address: [`0x170375B4aD477133a36B4961D9bcA6D5BF9C8389`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x170375B4aD477133a36B4961D9bcA6D5BF9C8389)\n- Variable Debt variableDebtBOND address: [`0x21D0366D1D678fCf276954b7D651B9dfeE104D82`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x21D0366D1D678fCf276954b7D651B9dfeE104D82)\n- Stable Debt stableDebtBOND address: [`0xb98EF546D1057f9750511FE16cBCC7Eb0FB6451F`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb98EF546D1057f9750511FE16cBCC7Eb0FB6451F)\n- Strategy Implementation for BOND address: [`0x273358d06Ca3862bf3C0691d1C8B4B4d3E906458`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x273358d06Ca3862bf3C0691d1C8B4B4d3E906458)\n\n### Price oracle\n\nThe BOND price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [BOND/ETH](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses) feed, [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd22A54e05410D8d1007c38b5c7A3eD74b855281).\n\n### Interest model\n\n- LTV 25%\n- Liquidation Threshold 35%\n- Liquidation Bonus 15%\n- Reserve Factor 35%\n\nInterest Rate Model\n\n- UOptimal 45%\n\nVariable:\n\n- R_0 0%\n- R_s1 7%\n- R_s2 300%\n\nStable:\n\n- R_s1 10%\n- R_s2 300%\n\n\n![BarnBridge BOND Aave interest rates](../assets/AIP-23/rate.png)\n\n## References\n\n- *Website*: https://www.BarnBridge.com\n- *DAPP*: https://app.barnbridge.com/\n- *Whitepaper*: https://github.com/BarnBridge/BarnBridge-Whitepaper\n- *Project Management Portal*: https://github.com/BarnBridge/BarnBridge-PM\n- *Youtube*: https://www.youtube.com/c/BarnBridge\n- *Twitter*: https://twitter.com/Barn_Bridge\n- *BOND token contract*: https://etherscan.io/address/0x0391D2021f89DC339F60Fff84546EA23E337750f\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

This suggests the maximum cap of the interest rate curve is not able to reach a high enough value to effectively balance incentives between the borrow side and depositing side of the marketplace.\n\n![Deposit and Borrow APY on AAVE, 7/24/21](../assets/AIP-26/apys.png \"Deposit and Borrow APY on AAVE, 7/24/21\")\n\nWhile the AMPL spot market is currently in a relatively extreme condition, the AAVE borrowing market should be able to perform efficiently in all market scenarios.\n\n## Specification\n\nWe suggest the following parameters for AAVE's default [interest rate model](https://docs.aave.com/risk/liquidity-risk/borrow-interest-rate#interest-rate-model):\n\n- Optimal utilization = 75%\n- Slope1 = 2%\n- Slope2 = 10,000%\n\nThis leads to a piecewise linear curve with two parts and three defining points:\n\n- Borrow Interest(0) = 0% APY\n- Borrow Interest(75) = 2% APY\n- Borrow Interest(100) = 10002 % APY\n\n## Rationale\n\nA higher cap of the borrow interest rate will allow the marketplace to have a more sustainable equilibrium.\n\nSince this will result in overall higher fees coming into the system, in tandem we also suggest lowering the reserve factor from 20% to 10% to incentivize more depositors. This would be submitted as a separate AIP to decouple these two decisions.\n\nWe believe a nonlinear interest curve is healthiest long-term and could likely be used by many other assets as well, however this work can be discussed more in the future.\n\n## Implementation\n\nA deployment of the existing implementation of the Interest Strategy will be used, with the following parameters:\n\n    optimalUtilizationRate: new BigNumber(0.75).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n    baseVariableBorrowRate: new BigNumber(0).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n    variableRateSlope1: new BigNumber(0.02).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n    variableRateSlope2: new BigNumber(100).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x509859687725398587147Dd7A2c88d7316f92b02#readContract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x509859687725398587147Dd7A2c88d7316f92b02#readContract)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Since then, there has been a near 100% utilization rate of deposited assets.\n\nThe reserveFactor allows the FeeCollector smart contract to receive part of the interest paid by takers of liquidity. Each asset on Aave has its own reserveFactor.\n\nAIP-26 raises the maximum borrowing rate for AMPL and would result in more fees coming into the system. This AIP proposes (in tandem) lowering the AMPL reserve factor from 20% to 10%. This shares more of the revenue with AMPL suppliers to further incentivize deposits.\n\n# Relevant Links\n\n- AIP-12 AMPL Listing: https://app.aave.com/governance/18-QmZZ7JqvEx99u7dMNFPBBnew3BgepLCmXRMrNi8y5ndpXn\n- AIP-26: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-raise-ampl-maximum-interest-rate/4996\n- Aavenomics: https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/\n\n## Implementation\n\ncall setReserveFactor(0xd46ba6d942050d489dbd938a2c909a5d5039a161, 1000)\n\nOn the lending pool configurator contract\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x311bb771e4f8952e6da169b425e7e92d6ac45756\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nAdd DPI as collateral support for DPI to the Aave market. \n\n## Abstract\n\nAdd DPI to Aave V2 market.\n\nThe DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) is a capitalization-weighted index that tracks the performance of decentralized financial assets across the market.\n\nDPI is an ERC20 token that enables users to gain exposure to a basket of DeFi protocols via single transaction. The reduced volatility and broad diversification is a great property for collateral.\n\nThe index is weighted based on the value of each token’s circulating supply. DPI aims to track the projects in DeFi that have significant usage and show a commitment to ongoing maintenance and development. At the time of writing there are 14 tokens included in DPI. \n\n## Motivation\n\nAave would be the first major lending protocol to integrate an index product into its platform. DPI is becoming a DeFi standard and adding DPI would dramatically increase support for these efforts. \n\nThere are over 12,000 DPI holders and growing. Adding DPI as collateral would bring users into the Aave ecosystem allowing capital, yield and value to accrue to Aave participants.\n\n## Specification\n\nDPI is a market capitalization weighted index product that follows a predetermined qualitative and quantitative methodology. The composition of the DPI portfolio is maintained by DeFi Pulse. \n\nThe DPI token has no governance characteristics and is predominantly traded via the V2 Uniswap DPI-ETH pool. DPI is supported and maintained by Index Coop and is built on TokenSets infrastructure. \n\nAt the time of writing, DPI has a market capitalization of greater than $220M and is the most readily traded DeFi index product.\n\nThere is an annual 95 basis point fee for holders of DPI that is split 70/30 between Index Coop and DeFi Pulse respectively. \n\nDPI-ETH earns INDEX rewards through liquidity mining, currently yielding upwards of 20% APR, in addition to around 5% in trading fee income with limited impermanent loss.\n\n## Rationale\n\nBy purchasing DPI, users are able to gain exposure to leading DeFi protocols in the form of a single ERC20 token. The risk of holding just a select few protocols within a portfolio is diversified away, giving holders broad theme based exposure to DeFi.  \n\nWith Aave currently making up 20.88% of DPI, there is no better way for Aave to support DPI’s widespread adoption, than to enable DPI being utilized for borrowing and lending. With DPI trading since October 2020 and 90 day average trading volume of around $7.2M.\n\nAdditional information see Index Coop’s website: https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi\n\n## Test Cases\n\nBeing a standard ERC20, the Aave protocol test cases already cover everything needed to support DPI. \n\n## Implementation\n\n[PR to list DPI on Aave](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/pull/114)\n\n# DPI - Aave Risk Assessment\n![risk table](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/1X/f70a01e836c22cddde12a245dea6b4250bdf98e3.png)\n\n\nThe DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) is an index product managed by Index Coop. At the time of writing there are 324,355 DPI in circulation. DPI was audited by OpenZeppelin in September of 2020, launched early October 2020, and has over 111,000 user transactions. \n## DPI Smart Contract Risk: C-\nDPI was audited by OpenZeppelin in September of 2020, launched early October 2020, and has over 111,000 user transactions. \n## DPI Counterparty Risk: C\nDPI is a product whereby holders of DPI have no metagovernance influence on Index Coop or the protocol within the index. DPI trades on the ethereum network and inherits the trust of the network much like USDC. DPI has over 12,055 holders and the DPI-ETH pool is Uniswap’s 17th largest at $90M. Anyone can Mint, Trade and Redeem DPI. \nThe DPI utilises TokenSets V2 smart contract has been audited by Open Zeppelin audit [September 4th, 2020] which identified privilege roles in many of the contracts. The key findings are highlighted below:\nThe Controller contract has an owner that chooses the contracts that comprise the system. This includes all of the modules, resources and the factories that can be used to make Sets. \nThe IntegrationRegistry tracks third party integrations that can be used in the system. It also has an owner that can add, remove and edit the integrations as desired. \nThe PriceOracle has a list of oracles and adapters that can be used to retrieve third party prices. It also has an owner role that can choose the supported oracles, adapters and price pairs. \n## DPI Market Risk: B-\nDPI’s price tracks the Net Asset Value of the underlying assets, by holding a basket of protocol tokens the volatility of a single asset is dampened. This is reflected by DPI having a standard deviation of 5.75% since exception compared to ETH and AAVE which has a standard deviation of 5.03% and 7.79% respectively over the same time period (03/10/2021 to 01/05/2021). When considering liquidity, the average daily trading volume is $7.19M, based on over a trailing 90 day trading period. However, DPI holders have the option to mint/redeem the underlying tokens within DPI which draws on the liquidity of the underlying assets and also allows for any deviation from NAV to be arbitraged away by traders.  \n\n\n| Statistics                  |       |\n|-----------------------------|-------|\n|30 Day Average Daily Volume  |$7.19M |\n|90 Day Average Daily Volume  |$7.19M |\n|1 week Normalised Volatility |0.05379|\n|1 month Normalised Volatility|0.05535|\n|3 month Normalised Volatility|0.05035|\n|6 month Normalised Volatility|0.05812|\n|1 year Normalised Volatility |0.05845|  \n\n\n|Risk Parameters      |   |\n|---------------------|---|\n|LTV                  |60%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|70%|\n|Liquidation Bonus    |10%|\n|Reserve Factor       |20%|  \n\n\n| Rate Strategy |    |\n|---------------|----|\n|UOptimal       |50% |\n|R_0            |0%  |\n|R_s1           |7%  |\n|R_s2           |300%|  \n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n## **AAVE AIP 32**\n\n**Liquidity Mining V1**\n\nLiquidity mining incentives were introduced for Aave v2 on 4/26/21.\n\n2,200 stkAAVE per day were allocated pro-rata across supported markets based on the dollar value of the borrowing activity in the underlying market. stkAAVE was distributed over AAVE to further align users with the Aave Protocol and increase the amount of AAVE staked in the safety module.\n\n![AAVE](../assets/AIP-32/v1-program.png)\n\nLiquidity Mining Recap (as of 7/15/21)\n\n-   Value Distributed: During the liquidity mining campaign, 198,000 stkAAVE will be distributed to borrowers and lenders on Aave v2, using ~7% of the Ecosystem Reserve. This equates to $82MM in rewards (AAVE VWAP since LM program started).\n\n-   TVL: v2 TVL rose from $7.8 billion to a high of $14.4 billion in mid-May. Stablecoin liquidity accounts for more than 60% of total Aave v2 liquidity.\n\n-   V1 to V2 liquidity migration: v1 liquidity decreased from $2.5 billion to $372MM since the liquidity mining program started. 40% of Aave liquidity was deployed in v1 before the LM rewards started. Aave v1 liquidity now accounts for less than 3% of all liquidity on Aave. This allows the community to remain focused on v2 and upcoming money markets.\n\n-   Growth in dollar value supplied and borrowed: The USDC and DAI markets experienced the largest increase in dollar value supplied and borrowed. Note - many users on these markets have recursively levered their position to maximize yields. Recursive leverage accounts for ~32% of all deposits on v2. This compares to ~40% on Aave’s Polygon market.\n\n-   Reserve Growth: Since liquidity mining rewards launched, Aave’s v2 reserves have grown by [~$7MM](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c).\n\n\nChange in v2 markets from 4/26/21 to 7/15/21\n\n![AAVE](../assets/AIP-32/v1-recap.png)\n\n**Liquidity Mining V2**\n\nAave's liquidity mining program is ending in the next few days.\n\nWe have seen several adjustments discussed in the forums including adding/removing new assets, allocating rewards based on health factors, additional vesting for stkAAVE rewards, and discouraging recursive borrowing. However, after discussing with several Aave community members and developers, these changes would require a heavy technical lift and potentially layer on a centralized distribution plan.\n\nWe are open to these changes in the future but to avoid a disruption to the liquidity mining program, we propose the following program for the next 3 months:\n\nThis proposal [passed on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmeHAwW7XwUD3vqYLMRPF8MJiXkj2nnbRg1ae7mZ1SNQdm) with 91.7k AAVE voting in favor.\n\n![AAVE](../assets/AIP-32/v2-program.png)\n\n**Rationale**\n\nDecrease in Daily stkAAVE Distributed\n\nThis program would decrease the liquidity mining distribution by 9%, saving $7.1MM for the Aave Ecosystem Reserve during the 3 month program.\n\nNew Assets\n\nThe goal of this program is to create a more inclusive liquidity mining program with the option to further refine the distribution once live.\n\nStablecoins remain the highest value asset for Aave v2. This program distributes 40% of the stkAAVE distribution to the USDC market given the USDC market size and utilization. The USDT distribution has been lowered and allocated to other stablecoin markets including DAI, RAI, PAX, TUSD, and sUSD. The DAI allocation has been increased to account for higher utilization and encourage more deposits.\n\nWe believe incentivizing several centralized and decentralized stablecoin markets will help build a more robust stablecoin ecosystem in Aave v2. As new stablecoins are onboarded to Aave, the Aave community can choose to include them in the distribution. The allocations across new markets will likely need fine tuning as we analyze borrow/lend activity.\n\nWBTC and ETH allocations have been decreased and re-distributed to DeFi tokens listed on Aave.\n\nSeveral tokens including LINK, YFI, xSUSHI, UNI, MKR, and BAL have also been included. The rewards for all of these markets are weighted 100% to lenders.\n\nSimilar to the first version of Aave’s liquidity mining program, we believe the distribution parameters will need to be further refined once borrow/lend activity is available.\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe intention of this AIP is to test a cross-chain transaction workflow that would enable the Ethereum based smart contract for governance for the Aave Protocol (the \"Aave Ethereum Governance\") to control the deployment of the Aave Protocol on Polygon (the \"Aave Polygon market\"). The proposal is written as a transaction that would make updates to a **mock** Aave Polygon market. If approved, the transaction would trigger a cross-chain message, flowing from Aave's Ethereum Governance, to a new contract - the `PolygonBridgeExecutor`. The `PolygonBridgeExecutor` would store the proposed market updates for a delay window, and then allow for the updates to be executed on the **mock** Aave Polygon market.\n\nThis proposal will allow testing the end-to-end crosschain transaction workflow for Polygon market governance using both the Ethereum and Polygon mainnet contracts in a way that cannot be replicated in another manner. This test will support the case in the future to transfer ownership of the Aave Polygon Market to Aave's Ethereum  governance.\n\n**In-Scope:**\nA test of the governance cross-chain bridge functionality on a **mock** Aave Polygon market.\n\n**Out-of-Scope:**\nTransferring ownership of the Aave Polygon Market to the Aave Ethereum Governance \n\n## Abstract\n\nTest an implementation of a cross-chain governance workflow, allowing Aave's Ethereum Governance to execute a transaction updating a **mock** Aave market deployed on Polygon.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBefore anyone in the community or otherwise can make a proposal to transfer ownership of the Aave Polygon market to a cross-chain bridge workflow, it is necessary that any smart contracts be tested as thoroughly as possible. This AIP is a `real world` test using the Aave Ethereum Governance contract to test the cross-chain bridge contracts on a **mock** Aave Polygon Market. The main reasons for testing to this extent are:\n\n+ Cross-chain / bridge transactions are relatively new and complex\n+ The risk of this workflow being deployed and not operating correctly would have a HIGH impact\n\nThe transfer of ownership of the Aave Polygon Market to Aave's Ethereum Governance is **not** in-scope of this AIP, but understanding the motivation behind that desired change is important to understanding the motivation for this test.\n\nThe current owner of the Aave Polygon Market a multi-sig wallet due to the time needed to build a cross-chain governance platform, as well as ensuring security for a new deployment on a new network.\n\nGiven the overarching goal that any deployment of the Aave Protocol be owned by decentralized governance, transferring ownership of the Aave Polygon market contracts to Aave Ethereum Governance, is an important next step. Additionally, we have developed and deployed a cross-chain governance platform aimed at providing a broad solution for cross-chain governance. After appropriate testing (including this AIP) and auditing of the cross-chain bridge contract, anyone can create a future AIP to remove the multi-sig over the Aave Polygon market and transfer ownership of those smart contracts to Aave Ethereum Governance.\n\n## Specification\n\nA detailed specification of the crosschain-bridge contract and workflow is outlined in the repo here\n\nhttps://github.com/Aave/governance-crosschain-bridges\n\nFor this test specifically, the test would flow from Aave Ethereum Governance, through a cross chain transaction to the `PolygonBridgeExecutor` contract. Then after a delay, the proposal would be executed on Polygon to make updates to the **mock** Aave Polygon market.\n\nThe general flow of this test will be\n\n1. Propose cross-chain test transactions (Aave governance-v2)\n2. Vote on cross-chain test transactions (Aave governance-v2)\n3. Queue test transactions\n4. Execute cross-chain test transactions\\\n4a. Execute transaction from Aave Governance (Aave governance-v2)\\\n4b. Bridge the test transactions to Polygon  (Polygon fxPortal and Polygon Inherent Bridge Functionality)\\\n4c. Receive bridged message on Polygon       (Polygon fxPortal and Polygon Inherent Bridge Functionality)\\\n4d. Queue transactions for execution in PolygonBridgeExecutor (Aave governance-crosschain-bridges)\\\n5. Wait for delay\n6. Execute queued transactions in the PolygonBridgeExecutor   (Aave governance-crosschain-bridges)\\\n6a. Turn off borrowing for the **mock** Dai reserve\\\n6b. Transfer POOL_ADMIN rights to a dummy address\\\n6c. Transfer ownership of the **mock** Aave market to a dummy address\\\n7. Confirm the expected updates have been made on **mock** Aave market\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis AIP will not make any actual changes in the current Aave Polygon market ecosystem or in any other deployment of the Aave Protocol. It is merely a test of a contract and workflow that, in the future, could enable the Aave Ethereum Governance to control the Aave Polygon Market.\n\nTesting the contracts that enable this cross-chain bridging as thoroughly as possible, including via this proposed test are rationale, despite their cost, given the critical role the cross-chain bridging will play if deployed and used for cross-chain governance.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nA full suit of tests with 100% coverage is included in the repo https://github.com/Aave/governance-crosschain-bridges. The cross-chain workflow has also successfully been tested on the Goerli-Mumbai test networks.\n\n## Implementation\n\nA mock implementation of this proposed test can be found here:\n\nhttps://github.com/Aave/governance-crosschain-bridges/tree/feat/mainnet-test\n\nAfter setting up the repository: \n\n`npm run hardhat mock-mainnet-proposal-delegate`\nruns on Ethereum fork to makes sure everything is encoded correctly to be submitted for the proposal\n\n\n`npm run hardhat mock-Polygon-test-delegate`\nset a .env variable `Polygon_FORK = \"true\"` to run the test updating the Polygon market via the mainnet PolygonBridgeExecutor on a Polygon fork\n\nTwo helper contracts have been deployed to support this proposal. `PolygonMessageSender` has been deployed on Ethereum and `PolygonMarketUpdate` has been deployed on Polygon.\n\nThis proposal, if executed, calls the function sendMessage() on the `PolygonMessageSender` contract on Ethereum mainnet via a delegatecall. The sendMessage function encodes a delegatecall to the function executeUpate() on the contract `MarketUpdate` deployed on the Polygon network and then sends that encoded action to the `PolygonBridgeExecutor` on the Polygon network via Polygon's FxPortal. When that action is received in the PolygonBridgeExecutor, it will be queued. After a delay, that action can be executed, calling the function executeUpate() which will make three updates to a mock aave market deployed on Polygon:\n\n1. disable the mock dai reserve via the LendingPoolConfigurator contract\n2. Set the pool admin to the address `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD` via the LendingPoolAddressesProvider contract\n3. Transfer ownership of the pool to the address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001` via the LendingPoolAddressesProvider contract\n\n**Related Contracts:**\n\n*Ethereum PolygonMessageSender Contract*\nPolygonMessageSender: `0xf442C0faE2E9A157cD0202BD63bf9b932D3aa4C8` \\\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xf442C0faE2E9A157cD0202BD63bf9b932D3aa4C8#code \\\n\n*Polygon FxPortal Bridge Contracts*\\\nFxRoot: `0xfe5e5D361b2ad62c541bAb87C45a0B9B018389a2` \\\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xfe5e5D361b2ad62c541bAb87C45a0B9B018389a2#code \\\nStateSender: `0x28e4F3a7f651294B9564800b2D01f35189A5bFbE` \\\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x28e4f3a7f651294b9564800b2d01f35189a5bfbe#code \\\nFxChild: `0x8397259c983751DAf40400790063935a11afa28a` \\\nhttps://polygonscan.com/address/0x8397259c983751DAf40400790063935a11afa28a#code\n\n*Polygon Bridge Executor Contracts*\\\nPolygonBridgeExecutor: `0x60966EA42764c7c538Af9763Bc11860eB2556E6B`\\\nhttps://polygonscan.com/address/0xd63b6b5e0f043e9779c784ee1c14ffcbffb98b70#code\n\n*Polygon Market Update*\\\nMarketUpdate: `0x5b494b94faf0bb63254dba26f17483bcf57f6d6a` \\\nhttps://polygonscan.com/address/0x5b494b94faf0bb63254dba26f17483bcf57f6d6a#code\n\n*Mock Polygon Market Contracts*\\\nLendingPoolAddressProviderAddress = `0x240de965908e06a76e1937310627b709b5045bd6`\\\nhttps://polygonscan.com/address/0x240de965908e06a76e1937310627b709b5045bd6#code \\\nLendingPoolConfiguratorAddress (proxy)= `0xd63B6B5E0F043e9779C784Ee1c14fFcBffB98b70` \\\nhttps://polygonscan.com/address/0xd63b6b5e0f043e9779c784ee1c14ffcbffb98b70#writeContract#code \\\nLendingPoolConfiguratorAddress (implementation)= `0xADA061366575324945c7a097F829349acA6C9aB9` \\\nhttps://polygonscan.com/address/0xADA061366575324945c7a097F829349acA6C9aB9#code\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

During these times, there can also be cascading, systemic effects from a lack of liquidations. For each loan that is liquidated, liquidators purchasing the collateral and selling it causes the price to further decrease causing further liquidations. On the other hand, if the bonus is too high, suppliers are losing out on profits to liquidators. Continual monitoring and adjustment of this parameter is crucial for optimizing the security vs. capital efficiency trade-off in Aave.\n\n## Motivation \n\nLarge liquidation bonuses increase the regime in which the incentives are counterproductive. [See section 6.3](https://gauntlet.network/reports/aave). Lower liquidation bonuses for a single week in May would have mitigated $4M in [depositor losses](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters/4854#mitigating-depositor-losses-4m-usd-13-of-total-liquidation-value-between-may-17-23-2021-7) while maintaining a low risk of insolvency.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bUXZCnB.png)\n\nUser experience is another factor worth considering. Depositor losses occurred for 590 distinct users during the week of May 17-23. Mitigating losses without increasing the net insolvent value percentage or the slashing run percentage is possible. \n\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset  | Current Liquidation Bonus | Recommended Liquidation Bonus Update |\n| ------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| ZRX    | 10%                       | 8%                                   |\n| WBTC   | 10%                       | 9%                                   |\n| SNX    | 10%                       | 9%                                   |\n| YFI    | 15%                       | 12.5%                                |\n| CRV    | 15%                       | 12.5%                                |\n| AAVE   | 10%                       | 8%                                   |\n| REN    | 10%                       | 9%                                   |\n| MANA   | 10%                       | 8%                                   |\n| BAT    | 10%                       | 9%                                   |\n| XSUSHI | 15%                       | 12.5%                                |\naccount.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonuses by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\n```\n{\n\"AAVE\": {\"address\": \"0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9\", \"liquidationBonus\": \"10800\"},\n\"BAT\": {\"address\": \"0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef\", \"liquidationBonus\": \"10900\"},\n\"CRV\": {\"address\": \"0xd533a949740bb3306d119cc777fa900ba034cd52\", \"liquidationBonus\": \"11250\"},\n\"MANA\": {\"address\": \"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942\", \"liquidationBonus\": \"10800\"},\n\"REN\": {\"address\": \"0x408e41876cccdc0f92210600ef50372656052a38\", \"liquidationBonus\": \"10900\"},\n\"SNX\": {\"address\": \"0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f\", \"liquidationBonus\": \"10900\"},\n\"WBTC\": {\"address\": \"0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599\", \"liquidationBonus\": \"10900\"},\n\"XSUSHI\": {\"address\": \"0x8798249c2e607446efb7ad49ec89dd1865ff4272\", \"liquidationBonus\": \"11250\"},\n\"YFI\": {\"address\": \"0x0bc529c00c6401aef6d220be8c6ea1667f6ad93e\", \"liquidationBonus\": \"11250\"},\n\"ZRX\": {\"address\": \"0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498\", \"liquidationBonus\": \"10800\"}\n}\n```\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFrax is the first algorithmic-stablecoin protocol, backed through on-chain collateral and algorithmically. Frax has two tokens, the FRAX stablecoin pegged at $1 and the FXS governance + seigniorage token, and aims to be a decentralized crypto-native unit of account with the upcoming Frax Price Index (FPI). FRAX has stayed at $1 for its entire existence, being the only non-traditional stablecoin to keep its peg perfectly in 8 months of release.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe FRAX stablecoin is partially backed with on-chain collateral and partially backed algorithmically, according to a collateral ratio (CR) parameter that the system adjusts according to market conditions. In Frax v2, the protocol is able to mint FRAX into lending markets using [Algorithmic Market Operations](https://docs.frax.finance/amo/overview) (AMOs), smart contracts which have the ability to print FRAX up to certain thresholds adjustable by governance.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs the value of Aave's TVL increases, borrow liquidity for stablecoins against volatile assets lent to Aave is one of the key benefits that is offered to lenders of the protocol. The flow of newly minted stablecoins to their decentralized lending market destination such as Aave is not always direct, and may face market inefficiencies through layers of actors.\n\nBy [deploying an AMO for Aave](https://docs.frax.finance/amo/frax-lending), the Frax protocol is able to mint FRAX to be borrowed by lenders of Aave, and thus offer an active and competitive alternative to other stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, and DAI. By allowing for responsive stablecoin liquidity, we aim to benefit lenders and the Aave ecosystem as a whole.\n\nAdditionally, With no collateral factor, there is 0 risk for Aave's money market in terms of the FRAX peg. Furthermore, if the FRAX peg broke and fell below $1, Aave borrowers would have less debt in dollar terms.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\n\t- Co-founder of Frax.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\n\t- FRAX is the world's first fractionally-algorithmic stablecoin, stabilized with parts on-chain collateral and parts algorithmically.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\n\t- Frax's AMOs are able to mint FRAX into the Aave lending market, allowing for highly competitive stablecoin borrowing rates for lenders.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\n\t- FRAX launched at the end of 2020 and currently has over $300M in circulating FRAX. FRAX has never once broken the peg of $1, even through sharp market downturns such as in March 2021. Frax's governance token FXS has maintained governance functionality since inception through a fork of Compound's GovernorAlpha.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\n\t- FRAX is currently used as a stablecoin in decentralized exchanges and other lending markets such as Rari's Fuse Protocol, where it is currently the most-borrowed and most-supplied stablecoin in several pools through Frax's AMOs.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\n\t- There is no emission schedule; FRAX is mintable by anyone anytime by depositing corresponding amounts of collateral and FXS into the system's contracts.\n\n7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n\n\t- The protocol is highly modular in terms of system parameters such as oracle addresses and AMO additions. The core contracts such as the token contract itself are non-proxy deployed and permissioned through governance's 2-day timelock, with a backup multisig admin address managed by the core Frax team.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n    - Market Cap: $307M\n    - 24h Volume: $15M\n    - Volatility: Extremely Low\n    - Maturity: Early-Mid\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\n\t- 13K followers on Twitter, 6.2K members on Telegram, Github is updated frequently.\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\n    - Date of Deployment: December 20th, 2020\n    - Number of Transactions: 110,000+\n    - Number of Holders: 1,600+\n\n## Rationale\n\nFrax's design rationale came as a synthesis of a crypto-native stablecoin with capital efficiency, allowing it to perform algorithmic market operations while managed by on on-chain DAO. As Frax expands, it can compound on its own network effects by being a highly liquid routing asset on DEXes and a default borrowing option for many lending market pools. To keep decentralization at the forefront, the USDC collateral is spread out through other lending markets and DEXes, and is planned to be rotated to ETH and ETH-equivalent collateral as the protocol matures. Furthermore, the Frax Price Index (FPI) allows for a shift away from the USD unit-of-account into the first major stable crypto-native unit-of-account.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe FRAX price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [FRAX/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nFRAX will only be used for depositing and lending and not as collateral, with a Loan-to-Value (LTV) value of 0%. The other parameters are as such:\n\n\n  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo\n  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n  - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n  - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n  - Borrowing Enabled: true\n  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n  - Reserve Decimals: 18\n  - Reserve Factor: 1000\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n- Interest bearing aFRAX address: 0x4ca44E16DAbcdB5a770eA623aca3adCcCde6fBb3\n- Variable Debt variableDebtFRAX address: 0x861CbFc3e727d2CF2F0af964395e447C28d4967e\n- Stable Debt stableDebtFRAX address: 0x6486f5664dbA438e233361ED87fE4D862638989d\n- Strategy Implementation for FRAX address: 0xe4DF757157234019682f25422Bcb01Ed659B9D29\n\n## Audits/Security Reviews\n\n[Trail of Bits Audit](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/FraxFinance.pdf)\n\n[CertiK Audit](https://www.certik.org/projects/fraxfinance)\n\n**Note that the risk assessment was performed in May 2021, when FRAX's market cap was $110M**\n\n**FRAX Smart Contract Risk**: **C**\n\nFrax has been live on the Ethereum mainnet for over 8 months.\n\n**FRAX Counterparty Risk**: **C+**\n\nCurrently the Frax protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig. The protocol is meant to be governance minimized with a gradual transition to DAO + comptrollers.\n\n**FRAX Market Risk**: **B**\n\nThe current FRAX market cap is over $307,000,000 USD. The average 24H trading volume in the past month has been over $14,000,000 USD. FRAX's volatility is negligible on Curve and Uniswap v3.\n\n**FRAX Overall Risk**: **B-**\n\n## References\n\nWhitepaper - https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-solidity/blob/master/frax_whitepaper_v1.pdf\n\nWebsite - https://frax.finance/\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/fraxfinance\n\nDocs - https://docs.frax.finance/\n\nGithub - https://github.com/FraxFinance\n\nToken Contract - https://etherscan.io/token/0x853d955aCEf822Db058eb8505911ED77F175b99e\n\n## Test Cases\n\n## Implementation\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Accounting for the over-approximation of the existing Slope2=10,000% interest curve requires reducing the slope2 parameter.\n2. Taking advantage of the exponential curve allows for:\n  a.

      "description": "## Simple Summary\n\nThree distinct levels from which the community can select a preferred risk tolerance for Aave V2. \"Moderate\" was chosen via [Snapshot poll](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi).\n\n## Abstract\n\nFrom a market risk perspective, the goal for Gauntlet’s simulations is to standardize Value-at-Risk (VaR) across all assets. Matching risk tolerance to a normalized expected yield throughout Aave V2 ensures no subset of assets adds disproportionate risk to the Safety Module.\n\nFollowing asset onboarding, empirical data on user behaviour (e.g., average health factors) and changes in market conditions (e.g., expected slippage) improve our simulation precision. Improved precision allows for higher confidence in model outputs—particulary for aggressive recommendations.\n\nGauging risk appetite is something Gauntlet will do quarterly to ensure our risk parameter recommendations track the preference of the Aave community.\n\n## Motivation \n\nThe existing [risk framework](https://docs.aave.com/risk/) has been instrumental in facilitating onboarding new assets. As expected and observed, liquidity risk, volatility risk, and market capitalization frequently change for all assets on Aave. Updating LTV and Liquidation thresholds to remain in lockstep with the market is key to improving the target metrics outlined in Gauntlet's [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters/4854#proposal-4) proposal.\n\n\n## Key Model Inputs & Notes\n\n| Asset | Volatility |\n| --- | --- |\n| USDC | 0.014 |\n| DAI | 0.017 |\n| TUSD | 0.031 |\n| WBTC | 0.72 |\n| WETH | 0.994 |\n| REN | 1.05 |\n| BAT | 1.08 |\n| YFI | 1.11 |\n| DPI | 1.12 |\n| LINK | 1.16 |\n| BAL | 1.17 |\n| MKR | 1.255 |\n| ZRX | 1.311 |\n| UNI | 1.331 |\n| KNC | 1.357 |\n| CRV | 1.4 |\n| XSUSHI | 1.51 |\n| ENJ | 1.612 |\n| AAVE | 1.72 |\n| SNX | 1.86 |\n\n- **WBTC**: Downside slippage values for WBTC have become smaller. This means liquidators see less slippage on trades and more liquidity. Additionally, a tight liquidation buffer will suffice given the lower market volatility.\n- **YFI**: Both slippage values and volatility have improved for YFI. The liquidation buffer shrinks between conservative and aggressive parameters due to marginal increase of liquidations observed during simulation. Doing so provides users an option to be more aggressive with starting positions should they choose.\n- **LINK**: Given market liquidity and LINK supplier's borrow positions, the aggressive setting will only include an increase in liquidation threshold.\n- **xSUSHI**: Recent liquidation analysis on empirical data, lacking previously, provides higher confidence that insolvency events can be mitigated. \n- **SNX**: The major concern with for SNX is that there is very high volatility and high slippage. The aggressive setting requires a larger delta between LTV and liquidation threshold to compensate for the additional risk. \n\n\n| Asset | Slippage Intensity Sell | Slippage Power Sell |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC | -0.134 | 0.52 |\n| YFI | -1.003 | 1.008 |\n| LINK | -5.648 | 1.14 |\n| XSUSHI | -0.864 | 1.049 |\n| SNX | -17.007 | 1.477 |\n\nSlippage calculation takes the form below:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/E9x1sFS.png)\n\n## Implementation\nThe proposal sets the LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nFull list of parameter updates can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-ltv-and-liquidation-threshold-levels-2021-08-26/5467/6?). \n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).****",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFei Protocol issues a decentralized, scalable USD stablecoin called FEI. FEI aims to become a widely used decentralized stablecoin that reduces centralization risk throughout DeFi.\n\n## Abstract\n\nFEI is backed by protocol owned reserves used to provide liquidity and stabilize the peg. The Fei community is committed to using decentralized reserve assets and oracles to have FEI be as decentralized as possible. FEI is an ideal candidate to be included on Aave to provide more decentralized stablecoin alternatives.\n\nAdditionally, Fei Protocol will be committing 25m FEI to bootstrap the market and 4M TRIBE in incentives for borrowing for at least the first 6 months.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBeing the liquidity protocol, Aave understands the need for robust capital efficient liquidity in creating healthy markets. DAI and sUSD being the current available options for decentralized stablecoins is good but likely insufficient longer term. Having more options like FEI will improve liquidity and optionality for protocols which are committed to decentralization.\n\nFEI brings with it substantial liquidity in the form of the $500m ETH-FEI pair on Uniswap V2. This can allow ETH leverage traders a capital efficient way to benefit from Aave liquidity and FEI liquidity. The yield paid by these traders will attract more FEI liquidity to Aave, benefiting both ecosystems.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n@Brianna is a core team member at Fei Labs focused on ecosystem development.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\nFEI is a decentralized and scalable stablecoin for DeFi.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nIf listed, FEI would be one of the most decentralized stablecoins on Aave. The Fei DAO can support FEI markets on Aave by providing FEI liquidity, approved via snapshot for 25 million. Traders will have the ability to tap into the large FEI-ETH liquidity on Uni V2 ($561 million) as well as any future protocol owned or incentivized liquidity pools.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nFei Protocol launched in April 2021 with a DAO since day one, and currently has over $643 million in liquidity. Fei aligns itself with the top communities and teams in the space, including Aave, with a similar decentralization ethos. There has been a large voter turnout during important community and team lead proposals that supported stabilizing the peg after the initial launch of the protocol.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\nFEI is currently being used in interest rate markets, including Fuse, and soon to be CREAM. FEI is growing and finding utilization in other financial service offerings in the broader DeFi ecosystem: synthetics, option platforms, exchanges and AMM’s, etc.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\nContracts within the Fei protocol have the ability to mint and burn FEI through processes that support stabilization around the 1 USD price target. The DAO controlled by TRIBE holders has the ability to mint FEI and appoint other Minter and Burner contracts.\n\nThe FEI contract itself is not upgradeable.\n\nAn additional role, the Guardian, can pause the minting of FEI. The Fei Core Team holds this role in a multi-sig, with the intention of either renouncing the role or transitioning to a community held multi-sig. More information can be read in our docs: https://docs.fei.money/governance/fei-guardian 1\n\n6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n\tMarket Cap: $527,000,000\n\t24h Volume: $70,000,000\n\tVolatility: Low\n\tExchanges: Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, Gate.io 1, MXC, Virgox, BiKi, etc. As reported by CoinGeicko 3.\n\tMaturity: Early-Mid\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n27K followers on Twitter, 2 17k members in Discord 3, Github\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\tDate of Deployment: March 28, 2021\n\tNumber of Transactions: 81,798\n\tNumber of Holders: 4,089\n\n## Rationale\nBecause FEI is an earlier stage project the proposal is only for depositing. The use of rateStrategyStableTwo, reserve factor, and disabled stable borrowing is appropriate for similar stablecoins per https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe FEI price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [FEI/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nFEI will only be used for depositing, not as collateral. The following params are proposed:\n\n\n  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableOne\n  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n  - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n  - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n  - Borrowing Enabled: true\n  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n  - Reserve Decimals: 18\n  - Reserve Factor: 2000\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n- Interest bearing aFEI: 0xAcF35Af93a65904C50ED93dfb010bAAdEBb4ccF0\n- Variable Debt variableDebtFEI: 0x1B669D5034143E272b5Ff548f2878735A2F3505A\n- Stable Debt stableDebtFEI: 0x1DdcF68f4C2600CBE534212765F964342a2faf02\n- Strategy Implementation for FEI: 0xF0bA2a8c12A2354c075b363765EAe825619bd490\n\nAdditionally the Fei Smart Contracts team contributed an ERC-20 compatibile incentives controller contract to the Aave codebase so other teams can add rewards in their native token: https://github.com/aave/incentives-proposal/pull/5 \n\n- TRIBE Incentives Controller Implementation: 0xff865335401f12b88fa3ff5a3a51685a7f224191\n- and proxy: 0xDee5c1662bBfF8f80f7c572D8091BF251b3B0dAB\n\n## References\n\nWebsite - https://fei.money/\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/feiprotocol\n\nDocs - https://docs.fei.money/\n\nGithub - https://github.com/fei-protocol\n\nToken Contract - https://etherscan.io/token/0x956F47F50A910163D8BF957Cf5846D573E7f87CA\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

We propose the following parameters, which produces the curve below.\n\n* Optimal utilization = 80%\n* Base rate = 1%\n* Slope1 = 2%\n* Slope2 = 750%\n\n\n![|624x384](https://github.com/aave/aip/blob/debf98b7ebe21b2964b3dc03843854c78709d813/content/assets/AIP-35/curve.png?raw=true \"Chart\")\n\n##### APY table above 80% Utilization:\n\n|Utilization|APY|\n|---|---|\n|80.00%|3.05%|\n|81.00%|49.93%|\n|82.00%|118.15%|\n|83.00%|217.40%|\n|84.00%|361.82%|\n|85.00%|571.94%|\n|86.00%|877.67%|\n|87.00%|1322.50%|\n|88.00%|1969.72%|\n|89.00%|2911.43%|\n|90.00%|4281.60%|\n|91.00%|6275.19%|\n|92.00%|9175.85%|\n|93.00%|13396.29%|\n|94.00%|19536.98%|\n|95.00%|28471.63%|\n|96.00%|41471.48%|\n|97.00%|60386.14%|\n|98.00%|87906.81%|\n|99.00%|127949.14%|\n|100.00%|186210.38%|\n\n                                           \n##### The part of the curve under 80% Utilization:    \n\n**![|624x325](https://github.com/aave/aip/blob/debf98b7ebe21b2964b3dc03843854c78709d813/content/assets/AIP-35/curve_under_optimal.png?raw=true \"Chart\")**\n\n## Rationale\n\n1. Accounting for the over-approximation of the existing Slope2=10,000% interest curve requires reducing the slope2 parameter.\n2. Taking advantage of the exponential curve allows for:\n  a. Setting a higher optimal utilization rate.\n  b. Setting a higher maximum APY to reduce the potential for\n     utilization being at 100% for extended periods without creating a too steep of an interest rate increase right above the optimal utilization rate.\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nA deployment of the existing implementation of the Interest Strategy will be used, with the following parameters:\n\n    optimalUtilizationRate: new BigNumber(0.8).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n    baseVariableBorrowRate: new BigNumber(0).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n    variableRateSlope1: new BigNumber(0.02).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n    variableRateSlope2: new BigNumber(7.5).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x84d1FaD9559b8AC1Fda17d073B8542c8Fb6986dd#readContract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x84d1FaD9559b8AC1Fda17d073B8542c8Fb6986dd#readContract)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFei Protocol issues a decentralized, scalable USD stablecoin called FEI. FEI aims to become a widely used decentralized stablecoin that reduces centralization risk throughout DeFi.\n\n## Abstract\n\nFEI is backed by protocol owned reserves used to provide liquidity and stabilize the peg. The Fei community is committed to using decentralized reserve assets and oracles to have FEI be as decentralized as possible. FEI is an ideal candidate to be included on Aave to provide more decentralized stablecoin alternatives.\n\nAdditionally, Fei Protocol will be committing 25m FEI to bootstrap the market and 4M TRIBE in incentives for borrowing for at least the first 6 months.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBeing the liquidity protocol, Aave understands the need for robust capital efficient liquidity in creating healthy markets. DAI and sUSD being the current available options for decentralized stablecoins is good but likely insufficient longer term. Having more options like FEI will improve liquidity and optionality for protocols which are committed to decentralization.\n\nFEI brings with it substantial liquidity in the form of the $500m ETH-FEI pair on Uniswap V2. This can allow ETH leverage traders a capital efficient way to benefit from Aave liquidity and FEI liquidity. The yield paid by these traders will attract more FEI liquidity to Aave, benefiting both ecosystems.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n@Brianna is a core team member at Fei Labs focused on ecosystem development.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\nFEI is a decentralized and scalable stablecoin for DeFi.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nIf listed, FEI would be one of the most decentralized stablecoins on Aave. The Fei DAO can support FEI markets on Aave by providing FEI liquidity, approved via snapshot for 25 million. Traders will have the ability to tap into the large FEI-ETH liquidity on Uni V2 ($561 million) as well as any future protocol owned or incentivized liquidity pools.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nFei Protocol launched in April 2021 with a DAO since day one, and currently has over $643 million in liquidity. Fei aligns itself with the top communities and teams in the space, including Aave, with a similar decentralization ethos. There has been a large voter turnout during important community and team lead proposals that supported stabilizing the peg after the initial launch of the protocol.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\nFEI is currently being used in interest rate markets, including Fuse, and soon to be CREAM. FEI is growing and finding utilization in other financial service offerings in the broader DeFi ecosystem: synthetics, option platforms, exchanges and AMM’s, etc.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\nContracts within the Fei protocol have the ability to mint and burn FEI through processes that support stabilization around the 1 USD price target. The DAO controlled by TRIBE holders has the ability to mint FEI and appoint other Minter and Burner contracts.\n\nThe FEI contract itself is not upgradeable.\n\nAn additional role, the Guardian, can pause the minting of FEI. The Fei Core Team holds this role in a multi-sig, with the intention of either renouncing the role or transitioning to a community held multi-sig. More information can be read in our docs: https://docs.fei.money/governance/fei-guardian 1\n\n6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n\tMarket Cap: $527,000,000\n\t24h Volume: $70,000,000\n\tVolatility: Low\n\tExchanges: Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, Gate.io 1, MXC, Virgox, BiKi, etc. As reported by CoinGeicko 3.\n\tMaturity: Early-Mid\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n27K followers on Twitter, 2 17k members in Discord 3, Github\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\tDate of Deployment: March 28, 2021\n\tNumber of Transactions: 81,798\n\tNumber of Holders: 4,089\n\n## Rationale\nBecause FEI is an earlier stage project the proposal is only for depositing. The use of rateStrategyStableTwo, reserve factor, and disabled stable borrowing is appropriate for similar stablecoins per https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe FEI price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [FEI/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nFEI will only be used for depositing, not as collateral. The following params are proposed:\n\n\n  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableOne\n  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n  - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n  - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n  - Borrowing Enabled: true\n  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n  - Reserve Decimals: 18\n  - Reserve Factor: 2000\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n- Interest bearing aFEI: 0xAcF35Af93a65904C50ED93dfb010bAAdEBb4ccF0\n- Variable Debt variableDebtFEI: 0x1B669D5034143E272b5Ff548f2878735A2F3505A\n- Stable Debt stableDebtFEI: 0x1DdcF68f4C2600CBE534212765F964342a2faf02\n- Strategy Implementation for FEI: 0xF0bA2a8c12A2354c075b363765EAe825619bd490\n\nAdditionally the Fei Smart Contracts team contributed an ERC-20 compatibile incentives controller contract to the Aave codebase so other teams can add rewards in their native token: https://github.com/aave/incentives-proposal/pull/5 \n\n- TRIBE Incentives Controller Implementation: 0xff865335401f12b88fa3ff5a3a51685a7f224191\n- and proxy: 0xDee5c1662bBfF8f80f7c572D8091BF251b3B0dAB\n\n## References\n\nWebsite - https://fei.money/\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/feiprotocol\n\nDocs - https://docs.fei.money/\n\nGithub - https://github.com/fei-protocol\n\nToken Contract - https://etherscan.io/token/0x956F47F50A910163D8BF957Cf5846D573E7f87CA\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "description": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce the liquidation bonus for eleven (11) Aave V2 assets.\n\n## Abstract \n\nThis proposal is an extension on the previous [ARC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-liquidation-bonus-updates/5300) for liquidation bonus updates and the corresponding [AIP-34: Liquidation Bonus Updates](https://app.aave.com/governance/30-QmccRszk94JUyj3xGcBUxUzCo43jZDQYgesEULsudVjm9v) that followed. Besides reserve factor changes, no risk parameter values have been updated since the launch of Aave V2. Gauntlet's simulations output initially targeted liquidation bonus values lower than we recommended. Over the past 10 days we have been able to monitor liquidator behavior and have reached higher confidence in further reductions. \n\n## Motivation \n\nThe updated liquidation bonuses fared very well since AIP execution on 2021-09-04. The liquidation bonus changes impacted about $7M USD worth of liquidations across 21 users. Despite small changes, a bit over $100k USD was saved for those users (mostly in WBTC and SUSHI). Additionally, no additional insolvencies were recorded after the 18% one day drop in ETH price.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Current Liquidation_Bonus | Recommended Liquidation Bonus |\n| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| WBTC (9%)                 | 7.5%                         |\n| REN (9%)                  | 7.5%                         |\n| BAT (9%)                  | 7.5%                       |\n| YFI (12.5%)               | 10%                     |\n| MKR (10%)                 | 8%                         |\n| ZRX (8%)                  | 7.5%                         |\n| CRV (12.5%)               | 10%                      |\n| XSUSHI (12.5%)            | 10%                      |\n| AAVE (8%)                 | 7.5%                       |\n| MANA (8%)                 | 7.5%                         |\n| SNX (9%)                  | 7.5%                         |\n---\n\n## Implementation \n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonuses by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

      "description": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust thirteen (13) total risk parameters across nine (9) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus.\n\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of three risk parameters based on previously selected community risk level preferences. First, a continuation of the two previous liquidation bonus updates, [AIP-34: Liquidation Bonus Updates](https://app.aave.com/governance/30-QmccRszk94JUyj3xGcBUxUzCo43jZDQYgesEULsudVjm9v) and [AIP-38: Liquidation Bonus Updates for Eleven Aave V2 Assets](https://app.aave.com/governance/38-QmciauyTVnoHG6bAXCxHjHqTsUfiDz7rSGFxMADqFgCh4z). Second, updated LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters to realign with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the community. \n\n## Motivation\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. While increased volatility affected most assets in the ecosystem, some tail assets experienced even higher volatility and larger collateral usage (supply that is significantly borrowed against). In addition, increased liquidity and decreased trading slippage for certain assets allow for lower liquidation bonuses. \n\n\n## Specification\n\n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| WETH Loan To Value     | 80%     | 82.5%     |\n| CRV Loan To Value     | 40%     | 35%     |\n| ENJ Loan To Value     | 50%     | 55%     |\n| ENJ Liquidation Threshold     | 60%     | 65%     |\n| MANA Loan To Value     | 60%     | 65%     |\n| MANA Liquidation Threshold    | 65%     | 70%     |\n| UNI Loan To Value     | 60%     | 50%     |\n| YFI Loan To Value     | 45%     | 50%     |\n| YFI Liquidation Threshold    | 60%     | 65%     |\n| YFI Liquidation Bonus    | 10%     | 8%     |\n| ZRX Loan To Value     | 60%     | 65%     |\n| XSUSHI Loan To Value     | 35%     | 30%     |\n| USDC Liquidation Bonus     | 5%     | 4%     |\n\n\n\nSee below volatility and collateral usage changes from 9/14 to 9/28 that were important drivers for the updated parameter recommendations.\n\n| Symbol | 09-28 Volatility | 09-14 Volatility | Volatility Change | Collateral Usage Change USD |\n|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| WETH   | 1.012094901     | 0.979191725     | 0.032903176       | -86338828                 |\n| ZRX    | 1.474725052     | 1.355540968     | 0.119184084       | -328484                   |\n| UNI    | 1.592116599     | 1.324486507     | 0.267630092       | 4821417                   |\n| ENJ    | 1.660170507     | 1.706717325     | -0.046546818      | -2369990                  |\n| YFI    | 1.248934665     | 1.122133261     | 0.126801404       | -1931790                  |\n| CRV    | 2.050875845     | 1.601331664     | 0.449544181       | -2047792                  |\n| MANA   | 1.514235863     | 1.510912129     | 0.003323734       | -1420138                  |\n| SUSHI  | 1.829557712     | 1.499754067     | 0.329803645       | 4744051                   |\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gbjBPsu.png)\n\n## Implementation \n\nThe proposal sets the LTV, liquidation bonuses, and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "description": "## Simple Summary\nA proposal to adjust thirteen (13) total risk parameters across eleven (11) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus.\n\n## Abstract \n\nThis proposal is a batch update of three risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations, the latest being [AIP-39: Risk Parameter Updates for Aave V2 assets](https://app.aave.com/governance/39-QmXQMnHQMP6KmwkCG8MjBCjxxNEeaHszh9FgFZFASkqPS2). \n\n## Motivation \n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Volatility for non-stablecoin crypto assets remains high. As such, we focused on supporting protocol safety for our parameter changes in this cycle. \n\nAdjustments were also made for three liquidation bonus values. These assets (UNI, BAL, LINK) saw increases in liquidity and trading volume and a reduced liquidation recommended value as a result. As always, simulation recommended values seek to maintain capital efficiency and uphold borrow usage levels.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| REN Loan To Value     | 55%     | 50%     |\n| SNX Loan To Value     | 20%     | 30%     |\n| SNX Liquidation Threshold    | 45.0%     | 55.0%     |\n| DPI Loan To Value     | 60%     | 55%     |\n| UNI Loan To Value     | 60%     | 55%     |\n| UNI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.0%     |\n| YFI Loan To Value     | 45%     | 50%     |\n| BAL Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.0%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Bonus     | 10.0%     | 7.5%     |\n| BAT Liquidation Threshold    | 75.0%     | 80.0%     |\n| ENJ Liquidation Threshold    | 60.0%     | 65.0%     |\n| MANA Liquidation Threshold    | 65.0%     | 75.0%     |\n| ZRX Liquidation Threshold    | 70.0%     | 75.0%     |\n\n\n\n## Implementation \n\nThe proposal sets the LTV, liquidation bonuses, and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2021-10-7/5854/3).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

      "description": "## Simple Summary \nA proposal to increase the voting delay period for all on-chain governance proposals (AIPs).\n\n## Background\nAave governance proposals (AIPs) vary in complexity, scope, and impact. As Aave  continues to make progress on its growth trajectory, it is becoming obvious that certain proposals need to allow more time for pre-vote analysis. For instance, [AIP-33: Add FEI to Aave V2](https://app.aave.com/governance/35-QmbfLFGJdZQn21pwJGQzVnFqLk4vXHTmHUhio8ArWmvVqZ) was, fortunately, able to be canceled, via delegation removal, rather than needing to use the [Aave Guardian](https://medium.com/aave/aave-protocol-governance-v2-has-been-activated-af4a4b228885). \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aCML4k3.png)\n\n\nThis month has seen the most governance proposals (9) of any month since Aave V2 has launched with no sign of slowing given the variety of authors and proposal type.\n## Proposal \nA formal analysis period is defined as a non-voting period where a proposal is active (e.g. submitted on-chain). Currently, the `votingDelay` configured on [Aave governance](https://etherscan.io/address/0xec568fffba86c094cf06b22134b23074dfe2252c#readContract) is set to 0 - voting begins immediately when proposals are created.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/J7ohC0U.png)\n\n\n We propose to set this voting delay to 2 days, in seconds, using the `setVotingDelay` method on the core governance contract. Setting the `votingDelay` will cause there to be a new review period between the proposal submission and when voting for that proposal begins. \n\n## Potential Side Effects \n- The Guardian is marginally more likely to be needed should time sensitive issues arise.\n- Gauntlet’s risk parameterization will see a delay from time to identifying a suboptimal risk parameter to executing a change. At least until a `riskAdmin` role is implemented. \n\n## Implementation \n\nWe set the voting delay using `setVotingDelay` on the core governance contract located at `0xEC568fffba86c094cf06b22134B23074DFE2252c`, with a delay of `172800` seconds, or 2 days.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

As of 11/2, 177M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://www.notion.so/7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 74M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://www.notion.so/2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There is currently 916K KNCL supply and 229k total borrowed on Aave.\n\nConsidering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ga0jHyO.png)\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/c2GahMu.png)\n\n\n## Implementation \n\nThe proposal sets the LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token. KNCL is frozen by using the `freezeReserve` method of the same `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2021-11-04/6072).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "description": "## Simple Summary \nA proposal to renew Gauntlet's [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters/4854) engagement for continuous market risk management to optimize yield, capital efficiency, and mitigate depositor losses.\n\n\n## Background\nSince mid-August, Gauntlet has provided [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters/4854) and delivered on all areas outlined in the original proposal. Gauntlet has published 7 ARCs, Snapshots, and AIPs on parameter recommendations (102 parameter updates across 21 assets), 2 [Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-updates-and-review/5572) [Risk](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-updates-and-review-october-2021/5887) Monthly reviews, new weekly risk updates in [Aave News](https://aavenews.substack.com/p/aave-news-risk-section-new-grantees), and launched the Aave [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave). Gauntlet has invested heavily in the proper infrastructure including ETL data pipelines, agent-based simulation infrastructure, and financial models that make possible the parameter recommendations and front-end [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave).\n\nThe below will outline how Gauntlet has been able to create value for the Aave ecosystem. We also describe specific ways the Gauntlet Platform will make an even more significant impact moving forward.\n\n## Impact of the Gauntlet Platform\n\nHow the Gauntlet Platform drives value to Lenders, Borrowers, and Aave stakeholders:   \n\n* Mitigating losses from liquidations and insolvencies - $6.7M of annual value\n* Increase capital efficiency and yield for users - $16.4M of annual value\n* Safely position Aave for sustainable growth \n\n\n### Mitigating losses from liquidations and insolvencies - $6.7M of annual value\n\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations save Borrowers' collateral lost to liquidators by safely lowering liquidation bonuses. When Borrowers' collateral are liquidated, they lose an extra portion of their collateral to liquidators. This bonus incentivizes liquidators but often can be reduced without sacrificing protocol risk.\n\nFrom our first liquidation bonus updates (2021-08-27) to present Gauntlet has saved Aave V2 protocol users $218,141 in liquidations due to lower liquidation bonuses, which equates to **$1,447,663** on an annualized basis. It is important to note that this time frame experienced relatively low levels of asset volatility. Higher levels of asset volatility would lead to more liquidations, and more savings realized. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, Gauntlet has reduced the total capital at risk due to insolvencies and liquidations when markets are under duress (Value at Risk). Gauntlet's parameter recommendations reduce VaR, following the community's [risk tolerance](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi), which protects Borrowers, as less capital is expected to be lost during market shocks. In addition, lower VaR accrues value to Aave token holders, as insolvencies lead to payouts from Aave's Safety Module.\n\nOn average, Gauntlet’s recommendations have shown a **14% reduction in VaR**. Our simulations observe an average of 0.48% of Aave V2's TVL being at risk on any given day. In the scenario where volatility reaches similar levels as Black Thursday, we expect to save Aave users an average of **$5,258,511** in liquidations and insolvencies.\n\nIn the future, should the community assign a `riskAdmin` role, Gauntlet can achieve more precise adjustments and streamlined risk management. Compared to the time-intensive ARC, Snapshot, and AIP processes, our response time during catastrophic market shocks would return tangible benefits. One example of this is adjusting liquidation bonuses swiftly to prevent liquidation cascades.\n\n### Increasing capital efficiency and yield for users - $16.4M of annual value\n \n \nOne of the core functions of the Gauntlet Platform is increasing capital efficiency for borrowers while controlling insolvency risk. Gauntlet's recommendations have led to higher borrow demand following lower collateralization ratios. On Sept. 4th, 6.1% of users had collateralization ratios below `2.00`. As of Oct. 21st, the number of accounts has grown by roughly 14%, and 8.9% of new accounts have collateralization ratios below `2.00`. **New positions opened after Gauntlet's parameter recommendations have higher borrow demand**, as seen in the histogram below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rSbMyaa.png)\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">Histogram of new accounts since 09/04 by Collateralization Ratio and Borrow Value</p>\n\n\nFrom another angle, [Borrow Usage](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters/4854#:~:text=the%20Gauntlet%20Recommendations.-,Borrow%20Usage,-provides%20information%20about) is an additional measure of capital efficiency and signifies how aggressively depositors of collateral borrow against their supply. Since Gauntlet's parameter recommendations, we have seen a **1.1 percentage points increase in borrow usage.** \n\nAlso, corresponding to these updates, an increase in yield for depositors has been realized. Depositor income the month before our parameter updates was $24.7M. The average monthly yield after Gauntlet's parameter updates was $37.7M. Increased capital efficiency and the resulting benefit to depositors should, at least in part, be attributed to risk parameter optimizations. Given the increase in borrow usage for the same amount of assets lent, Depositors will earn an estimated **$5.6M additional yield**.\n\nLet's look at an illustrative example of how a fast path, via `riskAdmin`, to parameter changes can facilitate opportunistically increasing LTVs and magnify impact. Say borrowers on AAVE have at least a 2% return on their borrowed capital above borrow cost. If we assume 50% of the year is low volatility, Gauntlet raises LTVs by an average of 5% during low volatility periods, and ~$20B of collateral on Aave, then we can conservatively estimate **$10M of value to Borrowers.** Those new borrows would also generate over $800K worth of additional interest income for depositors. \n\n\n\n### Safely position Aave for sustainable growth\n\nGauntlet's risk management empowers Aave not only to optimize existing assets but immediately support new assets. We have already made parameter updates for the newly added DPI in [AIP-43](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/43-QmZb3yBeYJv1ruGWfY1h7XNcya82Q6Jqs4Q7b5dDMwuN3U). \n\nGauntlet is also closely monitoring the growth and stability of new assets FEI and FRAX. Should market conditions allow for safely turning on collateral, which initial simulations suggest can be done, we will seek community consensus to do so. Doing so could unlock $80M in collateral today and scaling proportionally, using the DAI borrowed on Aave to that in circulation, tens of millions more. \n\nSafely supporting new collateral helps make the DAO sustainable beyond the Ecosystem Reserve.\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nGauntlet has launched a [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) for the community to provide key insights into risk and capital efficiency. The dashboard focuses on both the system-level risk in Aave V2 and the market risk on an individual collateral level. Our goal is to help convey our methodology to the community and provide visibility into specific parameter recommendations. The dashboard will continue to be updated daily.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/X9Z8t49.png)\n\n\n## Expectations\n\n\nGauntlet will continue to deliver on the same risk parameters and communications plan outlined in the original [Proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters/4854/5#:~:text=%24100k-,Expectations,-Risk%20Parameter%20Updates) while expanding the scope to include the two changes below:\n\n* Configuring Reserve Factors \n* Supporting Borrow Caps when the protocol is upgraded\n\n\n## Updated Cost\n\nGauntlet's standard liquidity protocol fee model has been updated universally since the original proposal. The updated formula to calculate the service fee still has four components:\n1. An asset multiplier to track risk management complexity \n2. **[Updated] A proxy for capital efficiency**\n3. **[Updated] A marginal base fee**\n4. **[Updated] 30-Day VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) of AAVE**\n\n\nComponent #1 remains the same. The asset multiplier calculation is log(Number of Assets, 10)*. New assets on the protocol add complexity to risk management. \n\nComponents #2, #3, and #4 have been updated. Total Borrow remains the best proxy for capital efficiency and is now calculated as the 30-day average and rounded down to the nearest $1B. The base fee now takes marginal reductions to be more scalable for DAOs. Lastly, the requested AAVE denomination has been updated to protect the DAO and Gauntlet from short-term price fluctuations.\n\n\n| Marginal Base Fee | Total Borrow |\n| ----------------- | ------------ |\n| 10 bps            | $0 - $5B     |\n|           5 bps   | $6B - $10B   |\n|         2.5 bps   | $11B - $15B  |\n| 1.25 bps          | $16B - $20B  |\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BWG7RI4.png)\n\n<sup>*Gauntlet quarterly service fee denominated in AAVE (table above calculated at $345)</sup>\n\n---\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn just a few months, the Gauntlet Platform delivered significant value to the Aave ecosystem, and importantly, the future impact will be even greater. Through rigorous quantitative analysis and agent-based simulation frameworks derived from industries including algorithmic trading and autonomous vehicles, the Gauntlet Platform empowers Aave to optimize yield, capital efficiency, and mitigate depositor losses. Gauntlet currently provides parameter recommendations covering over $49B of assets. Managing risk for numerous protocols allows our data scientists and engineers to improve our models ahead of realization events occurring on Aave. As Aave continues to scale, it is crucial to adapt and translate complexity into trade-offs to support community decisions. \n\n\n## Implementation \n\n* Aave v2 30-day average Total Borrow: \\$6.74B\n* 30-Day AAVE VWAP: \\$345.231184773\n* Current Number of Aave v2 Assets = 31\n\nThe quarterly service fee formula using the inputs above equals 5940 AAVE.\n\n  \nThis AIP implements one streaming payment to Gauntlet denominated in stkAAVE. The stkAAVE is obtained by staking AAVE from the EcosystemReserve. The payment makes use of [Sablier](https://docs.sablier.finance/) to implement a streaming vesting payment over the course of one calendar quarter. This payment can be revoked by governance using `cancelStream`. Specifically we make use of the following transactions:\n  - `transfer` `AAVE` tokens from the EcosystemReserve to the ShortExecutor using the Ecosystem Reserve Controller contract at 0x1E506cbb6721B83B1549fa1558332381Ffa61A93\n  - `approve` the `stkAAVE` token to stake the `AAVE` we transferred\n  - `stake` the `AAVE` into `stkAAVE`\n  - `approve` the `Sablier` contracts to spend the remaining vesting portion of the `stkAAVE`\n  - `createStream` on the `Sablier` contract, with the Gauntlet set as the beneficiary, to stream the `stkAAVE`\n\n\nExact calldata and target addresses can be viewed in the transaction which created this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\nLiquidity mining incentives were introduced to Aave V2on the 26th April 2021 via [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG) and then voted to continue on the 24th August 2021 via [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) for an additional [90 days](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC5Dc99a421e3FB9d64c7B5BBb47a5e072370eDE8#code). AIP-32 incentives are due to expire 22nd November 2021.\n\nThis AIP presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives for an additional 90 days from when AIP-32 finishes, up to including the 20th February 2021. The incentives will be distributed at a 30% reduced rate, commencing the tapering of incentives on the Aave V2 market.\n\nStable coin / low vol assets receive lending and borrowing incentives, split 1:2, in favour of borrowers over lenders. Aave V2’s revenue is derived from interest paid by borrowers and borrowing demand drives lending yield through higher liquidity utilisation. High vol assets receive lending incentives, skewed towards assets more recently listed and communities that have static relationships with Aave, like Balancer and Chainlink.\n\n## Abstract\nThe intent is to recognise liquidity mining incentives played a large role in helping grow Aave V2 TVL, whilst being conscious that competitors continue to offer incentives APRs marginally exceeding what Aave is currently offering.\n\nWhen incentives were reduced aggressively on the Polygon market, the daily revenue reduced significantly. There is a risk that by tapering liquidity mining incentives on Aave V2 too aggressively could trigger the same outcome as what was experienced on the Polygon market.\n- [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG): 2,200 stkAAVE per day from 26th April 2021\n- [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E): 2,200 stkAAVE per day from 24th August 2021\n- AIP-47: 1,540 stkAAVE per day from 22nd November 2021\n\nBased on the learnings from the Polygon market and reviewing the governance forum, this proposal reduces Liquidity Mining rewards by 30% over the next 90 days. For the following 90 days during 2022, the logic would be to continue further reducing incentives pending how the market reacts to the implementation of this proposal.\n\nIt is to the benefit of the protocol to incentivise borrows more than depositors. Conceptually, incentivizing borrows already increases deposit rates, so passive depositors still benefit significantly.\n\nTo encourage the depositing of high volatility assets, this proposal suggests incentivising the lending of newly listed assets and continuing to offer incentives on those that are strategically important for the Aave community. Offering incentives on newly listed assets is expected to kickstart the supply of liquidity.\n\n## Motivation\nAs a community member, liquidity mining has been great for bringing more users as stakeholders for the Aave Protocol and distributing the governance power to a wider more decentralised group of holders. Distributing stkAAVE means users also backstoppers of the protocol and automatically have skin in the game.\n\nI would say that most liquidity that a liquidity protocol such as the Aave Protocol needs is stablecoins - incentivised as diversely as possible and also encouraging stablecoins that are aiming towards decentralization such as RAI and FRAX.\n\nI would like to present to the community an opportunity to continue distributing stkAAVE at the same rate per day across the Aave V2 market with the intention of achieving the following:\n1. Grow Total Value Locked (TVL)\n2. Increase liquidity\n3. Attractive (low) borrow rates\n4. Increase the protocol income via growing the Reserve Factor\n5. Redistribute governance power towards users of the platform\n\nAs the value deposited within the Aave V2 market has grown from ~$5B to ~$21B and the $AAVE price has underperformed this growth, the incentive APR is lower now relative to the start of the prior incentive period.\n\nOn the 17th June 2021, the incentives on Polygon were reduced by 5x and revenue fell from $55.77K per day to $32.27K per day. This highlights the risk of reducing incentives to hastily. It is worth noting Compound is providing liquidity mining rewards similar to the existing 2,200 stkAAVE distribution level in terms of APR across key stable coin (low vol asset) markets.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lE7K7WfialLF8azUDUcpPCwAebWhqHnqi9x5ljWosp5mofq8IRSptYqPv2dXuV4m_IR3uVg3HqCXfTNNY5rzBBp9U5LDztOe9a3dv-ZjwZuFNs83H5ATP37G5tuCJqUrrjdC9uvh=s1600)\nRef. Details: [Phase 1](https://blog.polygon.technology/defiforall-kicking-off-l2-defi-summer-with-40-million-usd-in-liquidity-mining-rewards-from-polygon-for-aaves-polygon-markets/) and [Phase 2](https://blog.polygon.technology/defiforall-phase-2-polygon-defi-summer-continues-with-85-million-usd-liquidity-rewards-for-aaves-polygon-markets-6189f9c8b79/) Liquidity Mining on Polygon.\n\n## Specification \nThe below section outlines the proposed liquidity mining incentives to be applied from 22.11.2021 up to and including 20.02.2022.\n\nKey changes from the previous liquidity mining campaign:\n- 30% reduction in incentives to 1,540 stkAAVE per day\n- New additions BUSD, FRAX, CRV and DPI have all been included\n- Removed UNI and GUSD incentives\n- Incentives are skewed in favour of borrowers over lenders for low vol assets\n- Borrowing incentives are not offered for borrowers of high vol assets\n- Distribution of stkAAVE is pro rata based upon deposit dollar value\n\nThe table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the various Aave V2 listings. The overall number of stkAAVE distributor per day is the same and with a larger capital base, generating to a lower APR. The allocations are based loosely around the dollar value of deposits (lenders) and position users to borrow stables. The intent is to drive borrowing demand which will then lead to a higher lending APR. This is further encouraged by incentivising depositing of higher vol assets as collateral which will grow the TVL.\n\nFinal Proposal  \n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/6/669bbad486a552cb972b0fef3388489c107205bc_2_757x750.png)  \nNote: TVL per token is as per the 21st October 2021.\n\nMath: % of value deposited x multiplier then scaled to provide LM Allocation that totals 100%. [Link here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trx6tYr1jy5Izs-IfPTrGCp1y6EExCgyu4P8pme_Y_8/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nAll gas costs incurred implementing this AIP is to be reimbursed by Aave in the form of $AAVE. These costs work out to approximately 70 $AAVE.\n\n## Rational\nBelow is a list of the key considerations made when designing the third iteration of Liquidity Mining for the Aave V2 market:\n- Compound continues to offer liquidity mining incentives that marginally exceed those on Aave V2 marketplace. Thus, the risk is that if incentives are reduced aggressively capital migrates to another platform offering more compelling incentives.\n- When the Polygon market aggressively reduced incentives, TVL and therefore revenue dropped significantly. There is a risk that similar behaviour could be experienced on mainnet.\n- Borrowing is the key activity on Aave. Only borrowers pay a fee to use Aave’s liquidity and Aave’s portion of this fee accumulates in the Reserve Factor. Thus, borrowers technically provide more value to the protocol by:\n    - Increasing depositor interest\n    - Increasing reserve factor earnings\n    - Incentivizing borrows more than deposits reduces the maximum earnings from a “leverage loop”\n- Aave V2 TVL is heavily composed of three main stable coins (low vol assets) USDC, DAI and USDT. In effort to support the largest revenue generating pools, incentives are skewed towards low vol assets.\n- In an attempt to grow TVL and capture the less centralised low vol asset markets, incentives for lending and borrowing assets like RAI have been introduced and are treated in a similar fashion to existing more centralised low vol assets like USDC.\n\nCapital Efficiency and Risk Considerations\n- We did consider introducing a high health factor >2 which reduces the appeal of gamification and recursive lending. However, the implementation was [ruled out](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-extend-aave-liquidity-mining-rewards/4852/46) as too much work and increased centralisation of the incentive scheme.\n- Recursive behavior does not significantly increase risk as it is typically looped within a single asset. The Aave V2 market is designed to accommodate high levels of borrowing and the risk parameters set in place ensure the protocol is in a healthy state. The risk within the protocol is not connected to liquidity mining, but to the overall proper risk parameter management.\n\nEconomics\n- Aave V2 markets daily Reserve Revenue is averaging around $170K per day. Daily aToken interest is around $3K per day.\n- Liquidity Mining is estimated to cost $492,800 per day assuming 1,540 stkAAVE at $320 per token. Down from $704,000 per day assuming 2,200 stkAAVE at $320 per token.\n- Ecosystem Reserve is worth around $700M with an AAVE price of $320.\n- 90 days at 1,540 stkAAVE at $320 per token is $44,352,000 or around 6.33% of the Ecosystem Reserve.\n- The Net spend is $29,052,000 per day after taking into consideration the daily Reserve Revenue and daily liquidity mining expenses. This does not take into consideration the 550 AAVE/day Safety Module incentives\n- Daily Reserve Revenue is continually growing over time, any Reserve Revenue moving average trends higher from the middle of May onwards when the price of ETH dropped 60%.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1m4kq_urmX9q5f2ejJmoxlDUzFoi-vGWKJESgXR6oJ2XyTltDG5jHrOtdTr446PQDHUWMNyqy--zXqj1A9Yx82P4NTCpqh-fZORoRhiPoA7NTezP5kUKWD-UnuJj3mZSDs-m51TC=s1600)\n\nFurther details on the daily Reserve Revenue and Economic Reserve valuation can be found on the [Aave Treasury Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=180) created by the Llama Community.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CCO](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFireblocks asks the Aave Governance community to approve the appointment, adoption, and authorization of Fireblocks LLC, a Fireblocks company, as a “whitelister” on the Aave Arc market.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAave Arc is a “permissioned” version of the software underlying V2 of the Aave protocol that employs an additional smart contract layer to only allow “whitelisted” or “permissioned” users to engage with the protocol.\n\nOnly regulated entities that (a) employ KYC/KYB principles in accordance with FATF guidelines to identify and accept their clients; (b) have robust AML/CFT compliance programs; and (c) are currently in good standing with an active license/registration in the entity’s operating jurisdiction will be accepted as “whitelisters” on Aave Arc.\n\nWe believe that Fireblocks LLC, a Fireblocks company, satisfies all the qualification requirements to be a whitelister. We have performed a detailed analysis and documented it [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/add-fireblocks-as-a-whitelister-on-aave-arc/5753) for the consideration of the Aave Governance community.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDeFi is considered by institutional users to be one of the more complex markets to navigate across security, compliance, and risk perspectives. We are eager to be at the forefront of this transformational opportunity with Aave Arc by extending access to even our most compliance-conscious customers, who have been searching to engage with DeFi in a way that comports with their own internal requirements.\n\nApproval of Fireblocks LLC can potentially also facilitate the integration of other “whitelisters” and institutions into instances of the Aave protocol. This may have multiple benefits, including the creation of sustainable governance practices for Aave Arc whitelisters and whitelister customers, as well as the enablement of benefits to the ecosystem, such as the onboarding of regulated fiat on/off ramps and protocol deployments connected to debit cards, high yield savings accounts and other innovative fintech products.\n\n## Specification\n\n“Whitelisting” is the gatekeeping function performed by whitelisters on users of Aave Arc. The term refers specifically to the process of:\n1. Conducting KYC/KYB checks on the user;\n2. Onboarding the user with appropriate disclosures, terms, and conditions;\n3. Granting specific permissions (e.g., borrow, supply, liquidate) to the Ethereum wallet address(es) provided by the user.\n\nIn addition, Aave Arc whitelisters perform a similar role on Arc as guardians do on Aave V2. Specifically, whitelisters can use a multi-sig veto on governance proposals that add excessive compliance risk on the Aave Arc protocol. For example, existing whitelisters can veto the addition of a privacy coin if such a coin is impermissible in the relevant jurisdiction, or veto the addition of a whitelister that has a poor reputation for compliance.\n\nThe whitelisting is managed via a [PermissionManager](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE) contract, in which whitelisters are designated as Permission Admins.  Permission Admins are permitted to add or remove wallets grants to the Aave Arc market by calling `addPermissions()` and `removePermissions()` contract methods, respectively. \n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Aave community voted on the [Snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmYQEh4vstJADjSK2b8nyK1otFG6R4rh9VHszU5xUEw26S) with Yes 149.2k AAVE (98.33%) and No 2.54k AAVE (1.67%).\n\n## Test Cases\n\nTest cases for an implementation are mandatory for AIPs but can be included with the implementation.\n\n## Implementation\n### Proposal\n\nExecutes the proposal deployed at:\n\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0xA7fC6E204c2069edb0ed5Fed451F419B985eC416#code](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA7fC6E204c2069edb0ed5Fed451F419B985eC416#code)\n\nThe proposal executes the following:\n- Adds [Fireblocks](https://etherscan.io/address/0x686a12A79008246F4dF2f1Ea30d136BD6DE748B4) as Permission Admin by calling addPermissionAdmins` on the [PermissionManager](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE) contract.\n\n`IPermissionManager(0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE).addPermissionAdmins([0x686a12A79008246F4dF2f1Ea30d136BD6DE748B4]);`\n\n- Unpause the pool by calling setPoolPause on the [LendingPoolConfigurator](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e1c7865e7BE78A7748724Fa0409e88dc14E67aA) contract.\n\n`ILendingPoolConfigurator(0x4e1c7865e7BE78A7748724Fa0409e88dc14E67aA).setPoolPause(false);`\n\n- Transfers the EmergencyAdmin role of the system to the [ArcTimelock's Veto DAO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x33B09130b035d6D7e57d76fEa0873d9545FA7557).\n\n`provider.setEmergencyAdmin(ARC_TIMELOCK_VETO_DAO_ADDRESS);`\n\n- Transfers ownership of the system to the [ARC Market Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x23c155C1c1ecB18a86921Da29802292f1d282c68) temporarily until handed over to Aave Governance.\n\n`provider.transferOwnership(ARC_MARKET_MULTISIG_ADDRESS);`\n\n### Aave Arc Timelock\n\nAave Arc Timelock gives a guardian address the opportunity to cancel an approved governance action prior to its execution.\nThe timelock implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/aave/arc-timelock).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

These keys will allow the Guardian to pause the protocol in case of an unforeseen event, such as an exploit or other emergency.\n\nThe Guardian – a community multisig comprised of elected, reputable members of the Aave community – was established to protect the Aave Protocol in a number of ways, including against potential governance takeovers by centralized actors. Recently, the Aave community voted in favor of the Guardian holding the admin keys for new deployments of the Aave Protocol on different networks such as Avalanche.\n\nConsistent with its purpose to protect the Aave Protocol, the Guardian should hold the emergency keys for all deployments of the Aave Protocol in order to ensure security and safety for the Aave ecosystem. This will allow a more rapid response in the event of an exploit or emergency. As you know, the Guardians were a community-elected set of DeFi participants, builders, and capital allocators (see here for more info). These individuals are active contributors in the space, and are prepared to act at a moment’s notice to help the community and ecosystem mitigate risk.\n\nAlthough Aave Governance makes all decisions regarding the Aave Protocol, the need to act quickly in the case of an unanticipated event points to having the Guardian – a smaller DAO / multisig of ten – hold the emergency keys in order to be able protect the Aave Protocol and its users.\n\nTo protect the Aave Protocol from malicious actors, this AIP sets forth a proposal to authorize the Community Guardian to hold the emergency keys for all deployments of the Aave Protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\n## Test Cases\n\n\n## Implementation\n### Proposal\n\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Gauntlet has published 7 ARCs, Snapshots, and AIPs on parameter recommendations (102 parameter updates across 21 assets), 2 [Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-updates-and-review/5572) [Risk](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-updates-and-review-october-2021/5887) Monthly reviews, new weekly risk updates in [Aave News](https://aavenews.substack.com/p/aave-news-risk-section-new-grantees), and launched the Aave [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave). Gauntlet has invested heavily in the proper infrastructure including ETL data pipelines, agent-based simulation infrastructure, and financial models that make possible the parameter recommendations and front-end [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave).\n\nThe below will outline how Gauntlet has been able to create value for the Aave ecosystem. We also describe specific ways the Gauntlet Platform will make an even more significant impact moving forward.\n\n## Impact of the Gauntlet Platform\n\nHow the Gauntlet Platform drives value to Lenders, Borrowers, and Aave stakeholders:   \n\n* Mitigating losses from liquidations and insolvencies - $6.7M of annual value\n* Increase capital efficiency and yield for users - $16.4M of annual value\n* Safely position Aave for sustainable growth \n\n\n### Mitigating losses from liquidations and insolvencies - $6.7M of annual value\n\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations save Borrowers' collateral lost to liquidators by safely lowering liquidation bonuses. When Borrowers' collateral are liquidated, they lose an extra portion of their collateral to liquidators. This bonus incentivizes liquidators but often can be reduced without sacrificing protocol risk.\n\nFrom our first liquidation bonus updates (2021-08-27) to present Gauntlet has saved Aave V2 protocol users $218,141 in liquidations due to lower liquidation bonuses, which equates to **$1,447,663** on an annualized basis. It is important to note that this time frame experienced relatively low levels of asset volatility. Higher levels of asset volatility would lead to more liquidations, and more savings realized. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, Gauntlet has reduced the total capital at risk due to insolvencies and liquidations when markets are under duress (Value at Risk). Gauntlet's parameter recommendations reduce VaR, following the community's [risk tolerance](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi), which protects Borrowers, as less capital is expected to be lost during market shocks. In addition, lower VaR accrues value to Aave token holders, as insolvencies lead to payouts from Aave's Safety Module.\n\nOn average, Gauntlet’s recommendations have shown a **14% reduction in VaR**. Our simulations observe an average of 0.48% of Aave V2's TVL being at risk on any given day. In the scenario where volatility reaches similar levels as Black Thursday, we expect to save Aave users an average of **$5,258,511** in liquidations and insolvencies.\n\nIn the future, should the community assign a `riskAdmin` role, Gauntlet can achieve more precise adjustments and streamlined risk management. Compared to the time-intensive ARC, Snapshot, and AIP processes, our response time during catastrophic market shocks would return tangible benefits. One example of this is adjusting liquidation bonuses swiftly to prevent liquidation cascades.\n\n### Increasing capital efficiency and yield for users - $16.4M of annual value\n \n \nOne of the core functions of the Gauntlet Platform is increasing capital efficiency for borrowers while controlling insolvency risk. Gauntlet's recommendations have led to higher borrow demand following lower collateralization ratios. On Sept. 4th, 6.1% of users had collateralization ratios below `2.00`. As of Oct. 21st, the number of accounts has grown by roughly 14%, and 8.9% of new accounts have collateralization ratios below `2.00`. **New positions opened after Gauntlet's parameter recommendations have higher borrow demand**, as seen in the histogram below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rSbMyaa.png)\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">Histogram of new accounts since 09/04 by Collateralization Ratio and Borrow Value</p>\n\n\nFrom another angle, [Borrow Usage](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters/4854#:~:text=the%20Gauntlet%20Recommendations.-,Borrow%20Usage,-provides%20information%20about) is an additional measure of capital efficiency and signifies how aggressively depositors of collateral borrow against their supply. Since Gauntlet's parameter recommendations, we have seen a **1.1 percentage points increase in borrow usage.** \n\nAlso, corresponding to these updates, an increase in yield for depositors has been realized. Depositor income the month before our parameter updates was $24.7M. The average monthly yield after Gauntlet's parameter updates was $37.7M. Increased capital efficiency and the resulting benefit to depositors should, at least in part, be attributed to risk parameter optimizations. Given the increase in borrow usage for the same amount of assets lent, Depositors will earn an estimated **$5.6M additional yield**.\n\nLet's look at an illustrative example of how a fast path, via `riskAdmin`, to parameter changes can facilitate opportunistically increasing LTVs and magnify impact. Say borrowers on AAVE have at least a 2% return on their borrowed capital above borrow cost. If we assume 50% of the year is low volatility, Gauntlet raises LTVs by an average of 5% during low volatility periods, and ~$20B of collateral on Aave, then we can conservatively estimate **$10M of value to Borrowers.** Those new borrows would also generate over $800K worth of additional interest income for depositors. \n\n\n\n### Safely position Aave for sustainable growth\n\nGauntlet's risk management empowers Aave not only to optimize existing assets but immediately support new assets. We have already made parameter updates for the newly added DPI in [AIP-43](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/43-QmZb3yBeYJv1ruGWfY1h7XNcya82Q6Jqs4Q7b5dDMwuN3U). \n\nGauntlet is also closely monitoring the growth and stability of new assets FEI and FRAX. Should market conditions allow for safely turning on collateral, which initial simulations suggest can be done, we will seek community consensus to do so. Doing so could unlock $80M in collateral today and scaling proportionally, using the DAI borrowed on Aave to that in circulation, tens of millions more. \n\nSafely supporting new collateral helps make the DAO sustainable beyond the Ecosystem Reserve.\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nGauntlet has launched a [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) for the community to provide key insights into risk and capital efficiency. The dashboard focuses on both the system-level risk in Aave V2 and the market risk on an individual collateral level. Our goal is to help convey our methodology to the community and provide visibility into specific parameter recommendations. The dashboard will continue to be updated daily.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/X9Z8t49.png)\n\n\n## Expectations\n\n\nGauntlet will continue to deliver on the same risk parameters and communications plan outlined in the original [Proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters/4854/5#:~:text=%24100k-,Expectations,-Risk%20Parameter%20Updates) while expanding the scope to include the two changes below:\n\n* Configuring Reserve Factors \n* Supporting Borrow Caps when the protocol is upgraded\n\n\n## Updated Cost\n\nGauntlet's standard liquidity protocol fee model has been updated  since the original proposal. The updated formula to calculate the service fee has four components:\n\n1. A proxy for capital efficiency\n2. Base fee of 10bps\n3. 30-Day TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) of AAVE\n4. 25% discount for 1-year contract length\n\n\nComponent #1 is calculated as the 30-day average in Total Borrow. Component #4 signifies that a 25% discount is applied when the contract is 1-year (versus 1-quarter). \n\nSimply, pricing for a 1-year contract is calculated as:\n\n***Total Borrow * 10bps * (100%-25%) / AAVE Token Price***\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn just a few months, the Gauntlet Platform delivered significant value to the Aave ecosystem, and importantly, the future impact will be even greater. Through rigorous quantitative analysis and agent-based simulation frameworks derived from industries including algorithmic trading and autonomous vehicles, the Gauntlet Platform empowers Aave to optimize yield, capital efficiency, and mitigate depositor losses. Gauntlet currently provides parameter recommendations covering over $49B of assets. Managing risk for numerous protocols allows our data scientists and engineers to improve our models ahead of realization events occurring on Aave. As Aave continues to scale, it is crucial to adapt and translate complexity into trade-offs to support community decisions. \n\n\n## Implementation \n\n* Aave v2 30-day average Total Borrow: $6.74B\n* 30-Day AAVE TWAP: $308.23\n\n\nThe annual service fee formula using the inputs above equals 16,412 AAVE.\n\n  \nThis AIP implements one streaming payment to Gauntlet denominated in stkAAVE. The stkAAVE is obtained by staking AAVE from the EcosystemReserve. The payment makes use of [Sablier](https://docs.sablier.finance/) to implement a streaming vesting payment over the course of one calendar year. This payment can be revoked by governance using `cancelStream`. Specifically we make use of the following transactions:\n  - `transfer` `AAVE` tokens from the EcosystemReserve to the ShortExecutor using the Ecosystem Reserve Controller contract at 0x1E506cbb6721B83B1549fa1558332381Ffa61A93\n  - `approve` the `stkAAVE` token to stake the `AAVE` we transferred\n  - `stake` the `AAVE` into `stkAAVE`\n  - `approve` the `Sablier` contracts to spend the remaining vesting portion of the `stkAAVE`\n  - `createStream` on the `Sablier` contract, with the Gauntlet set as the beneficiary, to stream the `stkAAVE`\n\n\nExact calldata and target addresses can be viewed in the transaction which created this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

It basically turns Uniswap V3s liquidity positions into Uniswap v2 like ERC20 tokens. \n\nTwo G-UNI Pools have been deployed with Uniswap V3 Positions in highly concentrated ranges (centered around 1:1) on the 0.01% fee tier of both DAI/USDC and USDC/USDT markets. Add liquidity to these pools and earn auto compounded LP fees on these high volume uniswap v3 stablecoin pairs, just by holding the G-UNI LP Token. Because of the fungible nature of these G-UNI tokens which represent proportions of a shared Uniswap V3 position, they are a simple solution for lending and borrowing markets to onboard Uniswap V3 LP as a collateral type.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBased on several discussions with Aave stakeholders and Uniswap v3 Liquidity providers, we believe that the G-UNI DAI / USDC and USDC / USDT pool tokens would provide great value to Aave users as an efficient way of utilizing their USDC, DAI and USDT collateral to borrow other tokens while earning compounding trading fees on Uniswap v3. Moreover, this would enable Aave users to go leverage on their Uniswap v3 positions and potentially 50x the liquidity they provide and thus significantly increase their fees earned.\n\n## Specifications\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nGelato is the development team behind G-UNI\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nThe token is a wrapper around stablecoin pairs on Uniswap v3, it only uses Gelato’s network of keepers to automate fee compounding\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nG-UNI would enable Aave users to go leverage on their Uniswap v3 positions and potentially 50x the liquidity they provide and thus significantly increase their fees earned.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nG-UNI was deployed to Mainnet in June 2021 and since then projects such as Instadapp, MakerDAO, Float and Rari have integrated it. We worked a lot to understand the inner mechanism of Uniswap v3 and did 2 external audits to ensure the smart contracts we are using are secure.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\nAs Collateral in MakerDAO or for Liquidity mining incentives in projects such as Float or Fei for example.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nNo emission\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nAll pools will be immutable, as the upgradability key will or already has been burned.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nVolume corresponds to the volume of DAI, USDC and USDT on Uniswap v3\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nOver 20k on Twitter and 16k on Telegram\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nDeployed quite recently, around 50 transactions for the pools, only a couple of holders right now, but will most likely change with MakerDAO having integrated it\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe payload to list the two G-UNI Pools as collateral types on the AMM market and to configure their price oracles is deployed at this contract address: [0x67e4EDE946b3d76c4C505566eB821a1470507d2d](https://etherscan.io/address/0x67e4ede946b3d76c4c505566eb821a1470507d2d#code)\n\nTo execute the action governance simply calls `execute()` method (with no arguments) on the above contract address.\n\nOn execution both pools will be listed with the parameters in \"Simple Summary\" and with borrowing of G-UNI disabled.\n\n## References\n\n* [source code](https://github.com/gelatodigital/g-uni-v1-core)\n* [G-UNI docs](https://docs-g-uni.gelato.network/)\n* [about gelato](https://gelato.network)\n* [gelato whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M6i1sa-dRhodw08MCLseytHTdkeFweBH)\n* Ethereum addresses contracts\n  - [G-UNI DAI / USDC](https://etherscan.io/address/0x50379f632ca68d36e50cfbc8f78fe16bd1499d1e)\n  - [G-UNI USDC / USDT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd2eec91055f07fe24c9ccb25828ecfefd4be0c41)\n* ChainLink Oracle\n  - [DAI](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaed0c38402a5d19df6e4c03f4e2dced6e29c1ee9)\n  - [USDC](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8fffffd4afb6115b954bd326cbe7b4ba576818f6)\n  - [USDT](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e7d1eab13ad0104d2750b8863b489d65364e32d)\n* G-UNI Oracles\n  - [G-UNI DAI/USDC Oracle](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7843ea2e3e60b24cc12b56c5627adc7f9f0749d6#code)\n  - [G-UNI USDC/USDT Oracle](https://etherscan.io/address/0x399e3bb2bbd49c570aa6edc6ac390e0d0acbbd5e#code)\n* [audits](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AGg9HvaRM8SKlONRCv2rehlNkn5UwqJZ?usp=sharing)\n* Communities\n  - [Discord](https://discord.gg/ApbA39BKyJ)\n  - [Telegram](https://t.me/therealgelatonetwork)\n  - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gelatonetwork)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

The two quarter pilot program had a grants budget of $1 million and an operating budget of $250,000 per quarter. The pilot program has awarded $1.17m to 38 grant recipients and made the initial steps to put the grants process and the protocol in the hands of the community.\n\nMoving forward we propose renewing Aave Grants DAO with an increased grants budget of $2 million and an operations budget of $2 million per quarter. With the increased budget we will increase the number of larger community grants, fund non-developer grants including sponsorship and community events, and work to decentralize the grants process.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAGD’s mission is to build a thriving ecosystem of contributors for Aave. We provide grants to projects, ideas, and events that benefit Aave and its ecosystem. We hope to be at the forefront of ecosystem development at Aave. Ensuring a constant influx of talented builders is critical to Aave’s growth.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThe full test of this proposal can be found here: https://github.com/aave/aave-grants-update-and-renewal\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn order to transfer funds from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve, the proposal will target the contract ControllerAaveEcosystemReserve and call the function `transfer(IERC20 token, address recipient, uint256 amount)`.\n\n**Target Contract**\n\nControllerAaveEcosystemReserve = [0x1E506cbb6721B83B1549fa1558332381Ffa61A93](\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x1e506cbb6721b83b1549fa1558332381ffa61a93)\n\n**Transfer Parameters**\n\ntoken = the aave token [0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9](\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9)\n\nrecipient = the grants dao multi-sig = [0x89C51828427F70D77875C6747759fB17Ba10Ceb0](\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x89C51828427F70D77875C6747759fB17Ba10Ceb0)\n\namount = $2 million / ($189.67 / aave) = 10544.63 adjust for decimals = 10544630000000000000000\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

In addition, we propose freezing the KNCL reserve.\n\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe recent market downturn on the weekend of December 4th led to the most liquidations on both centralized exchanges and in liquidity protocols in the recent past. Most liquidations on the Aave protocol happened between 4:30 and 5:45 UTC when the price of ETH dropped nearly 13%. Below is a graph of liquidation by collateral and repay asset.\n![Liquidations by collateral and repay asset](https://i.imgur.com/gDTtU13.png)\nAlthough volatility for assets is slightly higher, the abundance of liquidity and active market participants is a positive sign for the health of Aave! For example, the total value of CRV (curve dao token) liquidated was large compared to the total collateral used on Aave. Lower LTV, lower liquidation threshold, and higher liquidation bonus protect the protocol from insolvencies. However, multiple liquidations of over 400,000 USD occured in quick succession. This shows ample liquidity for liquidators even in times of high network congestion. These market events provide important data points for measuring tail risk.\n\nFor reference, previous analysis of liquidations on Aave from May 2021 can be found here: https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/aave-protocol-liquidation-retrospective-may-2021-67c655fc1b31\n\nAlthough some assets currently have higher volatility, our analysis shows that it is safe to increase borrowing parameters and decrease liquidation bonus values. Our simulations study price drops and network congestion more extreme than was seen last week, and slippage and liquidity considerations have improved.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| BAT Loan To Value     | 70%     | 75%     |\n| CRV Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |\n| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 7.5%     |\n| REN Loan To Value     | 55%     | 60%     |\n| REN Liquidation Threshold     | 60%     | 65%     |\n| SNX Loan To Value    | 30%     | 40%     |\n| SNX Liquidation Threshold    | 55%     | 60%     |\n| SUSHI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |\n| ZRX Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |\n\n**Freezing KNCL**\nThe KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4/20, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 11/2, 177M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://www.notion.so/7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 74M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://www.notion.so/2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There is currently 916K KNCL supply and 229k total borrowed on Aave.\n\nConsidering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UV96hoq.png)\n\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonus, LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2021-12-16/6646).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The initial parameters for FEI will be an LTV of 50%, a Liquidation Threshold of 60%, and a Liquidation Bonus of 6.5%. Most of the stablecoins that can be used as collateral on Aave are more liquid, and our platform’s analysis conservatively recommends initially capping the amount of collateral that can be liquidatable to the average daily trading volume of FEI. If user behavior and market conditions over the coming months continue to show safe conditions for increasing capital efficiency on FEI, we shall recommend ramping up the LTV and Liquidation Threshold incrementally.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZmvleUX.png)\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonus, LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\n[Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2022-01-14/6942).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP would list BAL, CRV, DPI, GHST, LINK, and SUSHI from the AAVE V2 market on the Aave Polygon Market, and list GHST as a new asset to the Polygon market as collateral. WMATIC risk parameters are also being updated.\n\n## Rationale\n\nBAL, CRV, DPI, LINK, and SUSHI have been voted in by governance to be added to the Polygon market. These tokens are already listed in the V2 market.\n  \nWMATIC parameters are being updated to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGHST is the token that powers the Aavegotchi universe. Aavegotchi (Playable DeFi-backed NFTs) utilizes Aave aTokens in game as collateral assets for Aavegotchis “playable bank”. Given Aave’s recent launch onto Polygon (where Aavegotchi is deployed) the Aavegotchi community believes it would be a great idea to have GHST token as collateral on Matic Aave. If GHST gets listed as an collateral on Aave, users of Aavegotchi will be able to use aGHST as collateral within their Aavegotchis.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the availability of cross chain governance, it's time to make long overdue updates to the Polygon market.\n\n## Specifications\n  \nThe risk parameters for the assets coming from the V2 market to the Polygon market are as follows:\n\n#### BAL\n- LTV: 20%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 10%\n- Reserve Factor: 20%\n#### CRV\n- LTV: 20%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 10%\n- Reserve Factor: 20%\n#### DPI\n- LTV: 20%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 10%\n- Reserve Factor: 20%\n- Not borrowable\n#### LINK\n- LTV: 50%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 65\n- Liquidation Bonus: 7.5%\n- Reserve Factor: 10%\n#### SUSHI\n- LTV: 20%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 10%\n- Reserve Factor: 35%\n- Not borrowable\n\n## Adding GHST to the Polygon Market\n\n1. Aavegotchis are crypto-collectibles (NFT). Aavegotchis are pixelated ghosts living on the Matic blockchain, backed by the ERC-721 standard. Their value is determined by rarity level 2, which is calculated via multiple factors, such as base traits, amount of staked collateral 2, and equipped wearables. GHST token is the backbone of Aavegotchi Realm. GHST is an in-game asset, used in all operations in-game (excluding usage of GHST as a collateral for summoning your Aavegotchi, which are aTokens powered by Aave) such as buying portals (opened\\closed), wearable items, potions and etc.\n\n2. Users of Aavegotchi will borrow GHST, to use it as an in-game asset, to speculate on in-game values or for other in-game purposes. Users of Aavegotchi will use it as a collateral to summon their gotchis with it because aTokens are another backbone of the game. To summon your Aavegotchi you need to have a specific amount of aTokens to make it possible.\n\n3. GHST token has been live on Ethereum Mainnet since September, when it was launched via a continuous bonding curve DAICO sale (still live today at aavegotchi.com/curve 5). The token was launched at 0.2 DAI / GHST and currently sits at around 1.2 DAI. The all-time high is around 1.9 DAI / GHST. GHST is priced in DAI because unlike most tokens in crypto, it is actually backed by a DAI reserve at a 33% connecting weight. This makes the price more stable because it takes more in/out to change the price.\n\nA significant challenge for Aavegotchi as a project was deciding to migrate our ecosystem from Ethereum to Polygon (then known as Matic). Expensive gas fees would have made it impossible for our players to use Aavegotchi NFTs (which require constant onchain attention). However, from January to March, we were able to complete the migration and launch successfully onto Polygon.\n\n4. GHST is the official utility token of the Aavegotchi ecosystem and can be used to purchase portals, wearables, and consumables.\n\n5. The inflation of GHST tokens through purchases on the bonding curve is positively correlated to the GHST price. The bonding curve has been mathematically programmed to increase the price of GHST as the circulating supply of GHST increases.\n\n6. The bonding curve has minting and burning permissions, but these permissions are governed by the AavegotchiDAO which exists on Ethereum Mainnet. GHST tokens are not arbitrarily minted or burned. The supply is determined by inputs via the bonding curve.\n\n#### Market Data\n\n- Market Cap - \\$140,000,000\n- 24hr Trading volume - \\$29,209,070\n- Currently listed on 14 exchanges: Binance, Okex, Poloniex, Uniswap, Gate.io, LBank, Bilaxy, Hoo, MXC, BiBox, 0x, BamBoo Relay, QuickSwap, 1ich Exchange;\n- Maturity - 15 months.\n\n#### Proposed Risk Parameters\n- LTV: 25%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 12.5%\n- Reserve Factor: 20%  \n  \n#### Socials\n\n- Telegram group: - Telegram: Contact @aavegotchi 8 - 12,000+ members;\n- Discord - https://discord.gg/aavegotchi 16,000+ members\n- https://twitter.com/aavegotchi - twitter 67,000 followers;\n- Active forum https://dao.aavegotchi.com/\n- Governance Snapshot https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth\n- Active code development - https://github.com/aavegotchi\n\n#### Token Stats\n\n- Contract’s date of deployments: 14 September 2020 (Ethereum)\n- Number of transactions:\n  - Ethereum: 143,397\n  - Polygon: 2,507,992\n- Number of holders for tokens:\n  - Ethereum: 6,427\n  - Polygon: 68,943\n- Currently circulating Supply - 66,419,514\n- Current total supply - 66,419,514\n\n#### Full Disclosure\n\nStani Kulechov is an official advisor of Aavegotchi, and Aave has invested into Pixelcraft Studios, the development team behind Aavegotchi.\n  \n## WMATIC Risk Parameter Update\n  \nThe criteria for assessing market risk, as determined by the market size and changes in fluctuation in demand, is presented by the Aave community here. In line with the criteria, analysis of the MATIC token on Polygon network is presented below:\n\n|Holders:|168,102|B+ to A-|B+|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Transactions|100,240,631|A||\n|Mkt Cap|586,568,252|B+ to A-||\n|Av. Vol.|$50,675,854|C+ to B-||\n|Norm. Vol|0.06579|C+ to B-||\n\nThe MATIC token risk score compiled by Index Coop is B+. This matches the risk score cited here 1. However, the volatility score of B- (C+ to B-) is justified by the 0.06579 score compared to 0.064 in the table presented in the documentation 1. Further to this, assets like BAL and BAT on Ethereum have similar vol characteristics to wMATIC on Polygon. The Norm. Vol parameter is the average of the t=30 days and t=90 days as shown in the below table.\n  \n#### wMATIC Volatility Data (Polygon Network Data)\n\n|Time|S.D Vol|\n| --- | --- |\n|t=7 days|0.08475|\n|t=30 days|0.06535|\n|t= 90 days|0.06622|\n|t= 180 days|0.09013|\n|t= 365 days|NA|\n\nBased upon the volatility data share above, Index Coop suggests changing the Liquidation Threshold and Loan to Value parameters as shown below:\n\n|Parameter|Current Value|Recommended Value|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|wMATIC Liquidation Threshold|65%|70%|\n|wMATIC Loan to Value|50%|65%| \n\n## Implementation\n\nThis proposal is the first cross chain proposal for AAVE. AAVE holders will vote through the Ethereum mainnet to change parameters on the Polygon market. The proposal makes use of the [cross chain bridge](https://github.com/aave/governance-crosschain-bridges) to send a message to the [Polygon bridge executor](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xdc9A35B16DB4e126cFeDC41322b3a36454B1F772). The following functions are called on the [lending pool configurator](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x26db2b833021583566323e3b8985999981b9f1f3) from the executor:\n\nFor GHST, BAL, DPI, CRV, SUSHI, LINK:\n* batchInitReserve((address aTokenImpl, address stableDebtImpl, address variableDebtImpl, uint8 decimals, address interestRateStrategy, address underlyingAsset, address treasury, address incentivesController, string underlyingAssetName, string aTokenName, string aTokenSymbol, string varTokenName, string varTokenSymbol, string stableDebtName, string stableDebtSymbol, bytes params)[])\n* setReserveFactor(address asset, uint256 reserveFactor)\n\nFor GHST, BAL, CRV, LINK:\n* enableBorrowingOnReserve(address asset, bool stableBorrowEnabled)\n\nFor GHST, BAL, DPI, CRV, SUSHI, LINK, WMATIC:\n* configureReserveAsCollateral(address asset, uint256 ltv, uint256 liquidationThreshold, uint256 liquidationBonus)\n\nAnd the following function is called on the [Aave Oracle](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x0229f777b0fab107f9591a41d5f02e4e98db6f2d#code) for GHST, BAL, DPI, CRV, SUSHI, LINK:\n* setAssetSources(address[] assets, address[] sources)\n\nA payload contract has been created to initiate all the above changes.\n\n[Payload Contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8b97a0B37974Ddec0CB8B8039a4e593457DefE8c)\n\nTests and implementation are located [here](https://github.com/pakim249CAL/Polygon-Asset-Deployment-Generic-Executor).\n",

      "description": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust eleven (11) total risk parameters across seven (7) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus.\n\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nOur parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Our parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Gauntlet's agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Our simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. The individual collateral pages on the [dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding other interesting inputs and outputs related to our simulations. For more information, please refer to our [Aave market risk assessment](https://gauntlet.network/reports/aave) where we provide a tactical understanding of our model architecture. \n\n\n## Specification\n\nThese past two weeks saw slight decreases in volatility and increases in liquidity and trading volume, which our simulations picked up on. In addition, our recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-downturn-gauntlet-risk-review-jan-2022/7190) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. We will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6oowyEt.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dHn0K4s.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VH422UW.png)\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonus, LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2022-02-10/7286/4).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The interest of SEBA’s clients and prospects for crypto earning products has grown substantially overtime. The launch of Aave Arc with its permissioned layer represents a great opportunity for them to access DeFi yields while remaining compliant with their regulatory obligations. At SEBA, we believe that this will directly benefit the Aave community with institutional liquidities accelerating growth in TVL and in protocol revenues.\n\nThe Aave Governance reviews and approves Whitelisters that will conduct the requisite level of due diligence on Aave Arc participants. As a Swiss digital asset bank, we believe that SEBA is ideally positioned to provide those investors with the flexible and fully regulated platform that they need to bridge new liquidities in Aave Arc. We have performed a detailed analysis and documented it [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-adding-seba-bank-as-a-whitelister-to-aave-arc/6661) for the consideration of the Aave Governance community.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith an increasing demand from institutional investors for accessing new opportunities in the DeFi space, SEBA has positioned DeFi at the heart of its strategy by developing a suite of products and services in relation with decentralized finance. Recently, SEBA has integrated several DeFi tokens into its proprietary institutional-grade cold storage custody solution, including AAVE.\n\nBeyond innovation and transparency brought by permissionless DeFi, SEBA is a strong believer that Aave Arc represents a thoughtful response to a growing institutional demand, which is subject to anti-money laundering (AML) and combatting the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations in various jurisdictions. In line with that vision and with innovation at the center of its values, SEBA believes it fulfills the key attributes to perform the role of Whitelister in Aave Arc.\n\n## Specification\n\n[Reference](https://github.com/aave/aip/blob/9da687033ae0536377b822c9196dd783be0e3e65/content/aips/4C7076AA6CC7-AIP-FIREBLOCKS-WHITELISTER-ON-AAVE-ARC.md#specification) to standard.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Aave community voted on the [Snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmNfumVDA2GkmyA3xWC12HhDFGBUybSAHUpvygqkMnV34V) with Yes 324K AAVE (100%) and No 3.3 AAVE (0%).\n\n## Implementation\n### Proposal\n\nThe proposal executes a single call to the [PermissionManager](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE) contract to add [SEBA](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC5eeEd1a811b77d64A37d94CF0363bA716375FDd) as PermissionAdmin in Aave ARC market:\n`IPermissionManager(0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE).addPermissionAdmins([0xC5eeEd1a811b77d64A37d94CF0363bA716375FDd]);`\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis ARC presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives on Aave V2 Ethereum market for an additional 90 days from when AIP-47 finishes at a further 30% reduced rate.\n\nLiquidity mining incentives were introduced to Aave V2 on the 26th April 2021 via AIP-16, renewed by AIP-32 and then incentives were reduced by 30% with the implementation of AIP-47 which expires on the 20th February 2022. A summary is shown below.\n\n- AIP-16: 2,200 stkAAVE per day from 26th Apr 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n- AIP-32: 2,200 stkAAVE per day from 24th Aug 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n- AIP-47: 1,540 stkAAVE per day from 22nd Nov 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n- AIP-59: 1,078 stkAAVE per day from ~21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n\nContinuing on from AIP-47, incentives on low vol assets are to be split 1:2 in favour of borrowers over lenders. High vol assets will only receive lending incentives and this is skewed to favour more recently listed assets and communities that have a strategic relationship with Aave, like Balancer and Chainlink.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal continues on from AIP-47 with a further 30% tapering of incentives which was directionally communicated in the prior ARC and shall last for another proposed 90 day period. We will continue with the same rationale for how incentives are distributed across the Aave V2 Ethereum market.\n\nEven though TVL has reduced with market conditions, the incentive APR will fall due to the change in the $AAVE price.\n\nThe below section outlines the proposed liquidity mining incentives to be applied from ~21.02.2021 up to and including ~20.05.2022.\n\nKey details:\n\n- 30% reduction in incentives to 1,078 stkAAVE per day on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n- Distribution of stkAAVE is pro rata based upon deposit dollar value\n- A 35 AAVE bounty will be paid to the proposers to refund gas\n\nThe table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave V2 Ethereum market asset listings. In estimating the Borrowing vAPR, a 75% utilisation of the deposited assets was assumed. This was based on the current DAI utilisation.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/dd90b87dce468b384d8b2f0cfe20aab5d42fdbf9.png)\n\nNote: TVL per token is as per the 3rd February 2022.\n\nMathematics: % of value deposited x multiplier then scaled to provide LM Allocation that totals 100%. Link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trx6tYr1jy5Izs-IfPTrGCp1y6EExCgyu4P8pme_Y_8/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe previous LM campaign indicated the ongoing tapering on the Aave V2 Ethereum market that is presented within this proposal. The net incentive spend over the next 90 day period is reduced down from 1,540 to 1,078 stkAAVE per day.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe previous LM proposal provides a lot of the context and rationale to how the stkAAVE incentives are distributed across the various assets on both markets. Link [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946). Something of interest on the Aave V2 Ethereum market, large holders currently can turn a 336 bps and 344 bps profit based on the existing emission schedule across the DAI and USDC pools by recursive borrowing. (Lending vAPY, - borrowing vAPR, + Borrowing Incentives vAPR, + Lending vAPY)\n\nWith the newly proposed emission schedule this 336 bps return minus gas becomes a 289 bps and 292 bps profit before gas. Time in the pool is also a huge factor, and those already invested in this type of strategy may continue to do so. However, it would be a lot less appealing to deploy this strategy now. Tapering the incentives reduces the profitability of recursive borrowing but not sufficiently so to support unwinding the positions. The opportunity cost becomes more something to consider.\n\n## Economics\n\n- Aave V2 Ethereum markets daily Reserve Revenue is averaging around $44.5K per day during late January 2022. Daily aToken interest is around $1.9K per day.\n- Liquidity Mining is estimated to cost $161,700 per day assuming 1,078 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Down from $231,000 per day assuming 1,540 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Note, previous LM was budgeted using a stkAAVE price of $320.\n- Ecosystem Reserve is worth around $296.89M with an AAVE price of $150.\n- 90 days at 1,078 stkAAVE at $150 per token is $14.55M or around 4.92% of the Ecosystem Reserve.\n- The Net spend is $115K per day after taking into consideration the daily Reserve Revenue and daily liquidity mining expenses. This does not take into consideration the 550 AAVE/day Safety Module incentives\n- Daily Reserve Revenue has reduced significantly during January and the chart below shows the image of the recent market conditions. Not the economics above only takes into consideration Aave V1 and V2 market revenue.\n\nFurther details on the daily Reserve Revenue and Economic Reserve valuation can be found on the [Aave Treasury Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=180) created by the Llama Community.

This is done through the stETH token. stETH tokens represent a tokenized staking deposit with staking rewards and slashing penalties applied. stETH can be held, traded, or sold.  \nWe propose listing stETH to AAVE v2 market.

There is no intention to enable borrowing of stETH on AAVE v2 market.\n\n## Motivation\nListing stETH on AAVE can work to attract a larger audience to both AAVE and Lido. More ETH staked with Lido would subsequently benefit the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network, to the benefit of the community as a whole. stETH would likely bring new borrow demand to AAVE as market participants look to borrow against stETH.\n\nstETH makes a perfect DeFi collateral and is beneficial for a number of reasons covered in the Specifications section of this AIP.\n\n## Specification\n1. **What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\n- Jacob (jbeezy) is a full time member of the DAO working to facilitate integrations for st-Assets across DeFi in protocols such as Aave among others.\n- Gregory (GrStepanov) is a full time protocol contributor working on technical integrations.\n\n2. **Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.**\n\n#### Lido Background\n\nThe Lido Protocol, built on Ethereum’s beacon chain to start, allows users to earn staking rewards on the beacon chain without rendering their assets illiquid or maintaining staking infrastructure.\n\nLido was [announced](https://blog.lido.fi/how-lido-works/) in November 2020. The testnet was released in late November.\n\nLido today has 3 products (stETH, stSOL, bLuna) managed by 4 teams in separate organizations. Across these products is a multi billion dollar TVL and has pushed Lido to #6 on [DeFi Llama rankings](https://defillama.com/protocol/lido). stETH has also been accepted as part of Nexus Mutual’s treasury as part of their [risk management strategy](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/proposal-increase-the-allocation-of-the-capital-pool-to-steth/641).\n\nLido has begun the process to move over to a fully non-custodial solution. Details can be found here: [Withdrawal Credentials in Lido](https://blog.lido.fi/withdrawal-credentials-in-lido/).\n\nThe Lido DAO manages the liquid staking protocol by deciding on key parameters (e.g. setting fees, assigning node operators and oracles) through the voting power of governance token holders.\n\nLido has been audited by Sigma Prime, Quantstamp and MixBytes.\n\n#### stETH Background\n\nLido allows users to deposit ETH and receive stETH. The deposited ETH is then pooled and staked with node operators selected by the Lido DAO. stETH represents the user’s staked ETH balance of the beacon chain along with staking rewards accrued or penalties inflicted on validators in the beacon chain. When withdrawals are enabled on the beacon chain, stETH can be redeemed for unstaked ETH and accumulated rewards.\n\nUnlike beacon chain ETH, stETH can be freely transferred and traded. Onboarding stETH to Aave would allow users to borrow against stETH.\n\nThe balance of stETH is based on the total amount of staked ETH plus total staking rewards minus slashing applied on validators. stETH rebases daily.\nThe stETH supply stands at 1,697,460 - worth $5.4BN using current stETH prices.\n\n3. **Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nstETH as DeFi collateral is beneficial for a number of reasons.\n\n- stETH is almost as safe as ETH, price-wise: barring catastrophic scenarios, its value tends to hold the ETH peg well;\n- stETH is a productive asset. Earning rewards on collateral effectively lowers the cost of borrowing. This could make borrowing more attractive on Aave and help to increase market utilization (and therefore Aave’s protocol revenue from \ncoin reserve factors).\n- stETH is a very liquid asset with $5+ billion in liquidity used across [multiple DeFi projects](https://dune.xyz/LidoAnalytical/Integration-monitor-dashboard\n). stETH<>ETH liquidity pool on Curve is the deepest LP in DeFi with $3.8 billion TVL.\n\n4. **Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nLido protocol background is listed in Question #2.\n\nThere is a DAO and it is live. The Lido DAO consists of, amongst others, Semantic VC, ParaFi Capital, Libertus Capital, Terra, Bitscale Capital, StakeFish, StakingFacilities, Chorus, P2P Capital and KR1, Stani Kulechov of Aave, Banteg of Yearn, Will Harborne of Deversifi, Julien Bouteloup of Stake Capital and Kain Warwick of Synthetix.\n\nThe Lido treasury has been diversified and DAO members now include Paradigm, Three Arrows Capital, DeFiance Capital, Jump Trading, Alameda Research, iFinex, Dragonfly Capital, Delphi Digital, Robot Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, The LAO and [angels](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-ldo-treasury-diversification-part-2/506).\n\nThe Lido suite of products consist of st-assets which represent the underlying staked collateral on various protocols. Currently this is stETH, bLuna, stLuna and stSOL and is managed by 4 teams in separate organizations to further mitigate centralization risk.\n\nThere are further wrapped versions to address platform limitations around rebasing assets or bridging to other ecosystem. These wrapped assets are minted/burned based on locking of the st-asset. Currently there is wstETH (non-rebasing) and bETH (Terra representation of stETH).\n\nEarly challenges were overcome with DAO member support, speed of execution and utility of st-assets. The last one is particularly critical in the success of any liquid product.\n\n5. **How is the asset currently used?**\n\nstETH is used in a number of ways.\n\n- a productive asset (e.g. in Nexus Mutual Treasury risk management strategy);\n- compounding yield strategies in DeFI (AMMs, autofarms) (e.g. Convex, Yearn, Harvest);\n- multichain collateral (e.g. wstETH on Ethereum on Maker and bETH on Terra in Anchor).\n\n5. **Emission schedule**\n\nThere is no emission schedule. Similar to DAI, stETH is minted on demand when users lock ETH into the protocol.\n\n6. **Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nstETH token is the upgradable contract behind `AppProxyUpgradeable` proxy at https://etherscan.io/address/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84. Lido DAO can change the implementation with the successful DAO vote.\n\nThe roles and addresses can be checked in the Aragon UI: https://mainnet.lido.fi/#/lido-dao/permissions/app/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84\n\nTo mitigate withdrawal risks, Lido staking went live on December 18th, 2020, through a [withdrawal key ceremony](https://blog.lido.fi/lido-withdrawal-key-ceremony/). Chorus One, Staking Facilities, Certus One, Argent, Banteg (yearn.finance), Alex Svanevik (Nansen), Anton Bukov (1inch), Michael Egorov (Curve/Nucypher), Rune Christensen (MakerDAO), Will Harborne (DeversiFi), and Mustafa Al-Bassam (LazyLedger) came together over a four-day event to generate threshold signatures for Lido’s withdrawal keys in a secure environment on air-gapped machines. \nLido has already migrated to a non-custodial solution and >60% of all stETH already uses this. Details can be found here: [Withdrawal Credentials in Lido](https://blog.lido.fi/withdrawal-credentials-in-lido/).\n\n8. **Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\n**Market Cap** $5.5B\n\n**Volatility** - Over the past year, stETH proved to hold peg extremely well through various market conditions.

Thus, it has 2 private balances and 1 public balance.\n\n1. The internal (fixed-supply) balance and total supply are used for book-keeping. The deposited balance is stored in stETH shares and converted into the amount of the tokens with functions from stETH. Users’ balances are book-kept with the underlying ERC20 token.\n2. The internal (elastic-supply) balance and total supply correspond to the deposited balance without accrued interest. Rebasing of aSTETH according to stETH happens in this layer.  \n3. The external (elastic-supply) balance and total supply correspond to the deposited balance with interest.\n\nExternally, the aSTETH behaves similar to every other aToken. It always maintains a 1:1 peg with the underlying stETH. \n\nThe current implementation doesn't support borrowing, neither with variable nor with stable interest rates. The stableDebtSTETH and variableDebtSTETH contracts extend default stableDebtToken and variableDebtToken contracts accordingly to make it impossible to use borrowing with aSTETH because default debt tokens are not compatible with the AStETH contract.\n\n## Implementation\n\n#### Code\nAStETH https://etherscan.io/address/0xbd233D4ffdAA9B7d1d3E6b18CCcb8D091142893a  \nvariableDebtSTETH https://etherscan.io/address/0xde2c414b671d2db93617d1592f0490c13674de24  \nstableDebtSTETH https://etherscan.io/address/0x8180949ac41ef18e844ff8dafe604a195d86aea9  \nDefaultReserveInterestRateStrategy https://etherscan.io/address/0xff04ed5f7a6C3a0F1e5Ea20617F8C6f513D5A77c  \nSteps the proposal will execute: start a vote to add stETH as a new asset.\n\n#### Security Considerations\nStandard technical risks of smart contracts apply to the AToken implementation.\nThe implementation has been audited by MixBytes() and considered safe. Read the full report from [here](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/MixBytes%20AAVE%20stETH%20integration%20Security%20Audit%20Report%2002-22.pdf).\n\n**Proposed Risk Parameters**\nLTV: 70%  \nLiquidation Threshold: 75%  \nLiquidation Bonus: 7.5%  \nReserve Factor: 10%  \n\n**Interest Rate Model:**  \nUOptimal: 60%  \nBase: 0%  \nSlope 1: 8%  \nSlope 2: 200%  \n\nAs stETH is more suited as collateral instead of a borrowing asset, we propose listing stETH on AAVE v2 market with borrowing disabled. \n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n**Smart contract risks**\n\nLido faces smart contract risks. To mitigate these, Lido has been audited multiple times - by Quantstamp, Sigma Prime, and MixBytes (see [Audits](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits)), with no critical issues found.\n\n**Counterparty risks**\n\nLido is a DAO. Decisions in the Lido DAO are made through proposals and votes - community members manage protocol parameters, node operators, oracle members, and more. The Lido staking infrastructure for stETH consists of 22 node operators, with a focus on decentralization.\nLido relies on a set of oracles to report staking rewards to the smart contracts. Their maximum possible impact is limited by the [recent upgrade](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-2.md#sanity-checks-the-oracles-reports-by-configurable-values) (limit oracles report change by 10% APR increase in stake and 5% decrease in stake), and the operators of oracles are all well-known entities: Stakefish, Certus One, Chorus One, Staking Facilities, DSRV, Blockscape, Everstake, SkillZ, RockX, Allnodes, P2P Validator, and others.\nRead further in Lido [documentation](https://docs.lido.fi/token-guides/steth-superuser-functions/).\n\n**Market risk**\n\nOver the past year, stETH proved to hold the ETH peg 1:1 steadily.\nFour liquidity pools across different DEXes are incentivized with significant LDO rewards. Curve stETH<>ETH LP has grown into the deepest LP across DeFi, which makes it extremely resistant to any attempts of moving the peg.\n\n**Staking risks**\n\nstETH faces staking risks, specifically validator risks including slashing and hostage risks. To mitigate these, Lido works only with best-in-class validators with a track record of success.\nBesides, there's an ongoing [discussion in the community](https://research.lido.fi/t/lip-6-in-protocol-coverage-proposal/1468) about in-protocol coverage options to mitigate slashing risks.\n\n**Price feed risk**\n\nThe ChainLink price feed for stETH is based on the pools with extremely deep liquidity. This makes stETH price very stable and resilient. Manipulating stETH price at this point would require staggering amount of resources and potentially render this kind of attack unreasonable.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe past two weeks saw slight decreases in volatility. However, there were also decreases in liquidity and trading volume. Our simulations show that increasing borrow parameters across a wide array of assets could introduce significantly more risk in the short term. The below recommendations drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining risk at safe levels.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jq3kdSB.png)\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0UZoeQX.png)\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonus, LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2022-02-24/7385/2).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n​\n## Simple Summary\n​\nTerraUSD (UST) is an algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin. UST’s market capitalization has grown to almost $8.5B since its inception in October 2020. UST is designed such that each UST can be redeemed for $1 of LUNA and vice versa. This mechanism has kept the price close to the peg. \n \nAdding UST to Aave should drive additional stablecoin liquidity and borrow demand to the protocol. This proposal recommends a 0% collateral factor for UST.\n​\n## Abstract\n​\nThe version of UST added will be USTw (Wormhole UST). The Terra ecosystem is migrating from the centralized Shuttle Bridge to the decentralized Wormhole V2 bridge.\n​\nThe UST peg is maintained through an open market arbitrage system facilitated by Terra’s market module. An explanation of the contraction system is outlined below:\n​\nIf 1 UST is trading at .99 USD, users can buy 1 UST for .99 USD. Users then utilize Terra Station’s market swap function to trade 1 UST for 1 USD of Luna. The swap burns 1 UST and mints 1 USD of Luna. Users profit .01 UST from the swap. This arbitrage continues, and UST is burned to mint Luna until the price of UST rises back to 1 USD.\n​\nThe reverse works if 1 UST is trading above 1.00 USD. Through this system, UST has been able to maintain its peg within a relatively tight range.\n​\n​\n## Motivation\n​\nUST is supported by major Ethereum and Terra dApps including Curve, Uniswap, Sushi, Mirror, and Anchor. We believe there will be strong demand to borrow and lend UST given its stability and liquidity profile. UST will likely drive additional stablecoin liquidity and borrow demand to AAVE.\n​\nFinally, Terra has begun its migration from its centrally held bridge to Wormhole. This move should decrease the risks associated with UST while improving its network effects as it reaches more chains in the future.\n​\n## Specification\n​\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n​\nParaFi Capital is an active AAVE governance participant, submitting AIPs to list stable assets including FEI, and modifying liquidity mining incentives. ParaFi is also a user of AAVE and UST.\n​\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n​\nUST is part of the Terra ecosystem, started by the Terra Form Labs team. UST has been live since October 2020 and has become the largest decentralized stablecoin. The number of unique holders of UST has grown substantially over the past few months, and we expect that figure to grow as UST launches on more chains.\n​\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n​\nUST’s on-chain and off-chain liquidity profile have improved significantly this year. Additionally, UST’s stability has improved, especially during market dislocations. We believe UST will drive more stablecoin liquidity and borrow demand to Aave. \n​\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n​\nTerra is a blockchain protocol and stablecoin ecosystem centered around fiat-pegged, seigniorage style stablecoins. Terra was developed by Terra Form Labs. The Terra ecosystem supports dozens of DeFi and metaverse applications. \n \nThe wormhole Terra contracts have been developed by Certus One (part of Jump Crypto) and audited by Kudelski. The wormhole v2 contracts are in active development.\n​\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n​\nUST can be used in dozens of applications across Terra, Ethereum, and Solana.\n​\n6. Emission schedule\n​\nThere is no emission schedule. The supply of UST is expanded or contracted to maintain the $1 peg.\n​\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n​\nAs mentioned above, we believe the main concern with adding UST is its centralized bridge solution - this changes with Wormhole.\n \nThe Wormhole Network underpins the bridge with a validator set that observes the chains it’s connected on. The Network is governed by 19 guardians that watch connected chains and sign message observations. Users deposit funds onto the token bridge from where their tokens are originating (e.g. UST on Terra) and the action is deconstructed into a message which is sent to the Wormhole Network who validates it and produces a signed message. The signed message is sent to the output token bridge (e.g. USTw on Ethereum) which verifies it and sends the user the wrapped bridge tokens.\n​\nGiven the track record of UST, we believe the addition of UST would pose low risk to the Aave ecosystem.\n​\n6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n​\nMarket cap: $8.5B total\n24 hour volume: $100M+\nVolatility: Link to volatility data: https://governance.aave.com/t/add-support-for-terra-usd-ust/6003/19\nExchanges: Curve, Sushiswap, Uniswap, Balancer, Kucoin, Bittrex, Terraswap, Coinbase, MEXC, Gemini, Bitfinex\n​\n9.

This limits the risk for Aave and its users in other markets. As the wormhole contracts continue to be used and UST gains further adoption, the collateral factor can be increased. The use of rateStrategyStableTwo, reserve factor, and disabled stable borrowing is similar to other stablecoins per: https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters.\n​\n## Implementation\n​\nThe UST price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [UST/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses). The Chainlink UST/ETH Price Feed Proxy contract address is 0xa20623070413d42a5C01Db2c8111640DD7A5A03a. \n​\nUST will only be used for depositing, not as collateral. The following params are proposed:\n​\n​\n - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo\n - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n - Borrowing Enabled: true\n - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n - Reserve Decimals: 6\n - Reserve Factor: 2000\n​\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n​\n- Interest bearing aUST: 0x6C35faC782Be2Db776cdF777196a47916806892b\n- Variable Debt variableDebtUST: 0xd8aBEdc9CE320752e77C4A8706E64212EdE834B9\n- Stable Debt stableDebtUST: 0x107ed1832647436a0D39F09e65f4aA920242C0BB\n- Strategy Implementation for UST: 0x0dEDCaE8Eb22A2EFB597aBde1834173C47Cff186\n- Incentive Controller: 0x036cA61C1977c6EA52222Db81F725fDBd70eFBd7\n\n\nThe Incentive Controller was added in anticipation of LUNA incentives to UST borrowers/lenders being proposed by the community and thus for future engineering simplicity.\n​\n## References\n​\nWebsite - https://terra.money\n​\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/terra_money and https://twitter.com/wormholecrypto\n​\nDocs - https://docs.terra.money/ and https://docs.wormholenetwork.com/wormhole/\n​\nGithub - https://github.com/terra-money and https://github.com/certusone/wormhole\n​\nToken Contract - https://etherscan.io/token/0xa693B19d2931d498c5B318dF961919BB4aee87a5\n​\n## Copyright\n​\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal for significantly and continuously improving the security of the Aave platform and the dApps built on top of it, by offering our formal verification and path coverage tooling service to the Aave Platform contributors and the Aave Protocol dApp developers. The initial proposal is for 6 months starting from the execution of this proposal.\n\n## Abstract\n\nCertora proposes two approaches to significantly increase the confidence in the platform itself and in the smart contracts built on top of it, even when the code is evolving.\n\nFirst, we propose to change the project-based relationship of Aave and Certora, to an ongoing relationship, where we will provide ongoing support and rule-writing for Certora Prover on Aave’s code. This service will be provided to all community contributions to core and periphery parts of the Aave ecosystem. This will ensure that the constantly-evolving code of Aave’s platform remains secure, protecting its users’ assets.\n\nSecond, we will develop a new symbolic execution tool (path coverage) which will significantly increase the coverage of code areas where we look for bugs, complementing the more focused nature of the Certora Prover. This tool’s results will be visible to all via a unique dashboard we will build. In addition, it will be open-source, so the community could contribute to its development.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOne of the major risks in managing a complex system of smart contracts such as Aave's is that it is harder to ensure that changes introduced via governance are safe, and that they do not break the behavior of the protocol.\n\nThese risks were highlighted by a recent incident in which a bug was introduced in a Compound governance proposal, leading to huge nonrecoverable financial losses. Of course, such bugs are not exclusive to Compound— they have been affecting many DeFi protocols.\n\nDetecting vulnerabilities before they are deployed is difficult because of the lack of good security tools for smart contract development. Smart contract developers often rely on manual auditing to prevent bugs, but audits are difficult to employ in the setting of ongoing, time-controlled governance proposals. Moreover, even the best auditor can miss critical bugs due to the complexity of the code.\n\n## Rationale\n\nSee `discussions` for further information.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis AIP implements the proposal for its 6 months period. According to the forum discussion, the price is $1,700,000, where:\n1. $1,000,000 is paid in USDC. These funds will be transferred from the Aave Collector, and will be vested using [Sablier](https://docs.sablier.finance/).\n2. $700,000 is paid in Aave, also vested using Sablier.\n3. A one-time payment of $200,000 in Aave tokens will be transferred to a special 3/4 multi-sig wallet owned by the Aave Governance, 2 members from the Aave community, and 2 Certora delegates. The wallet will serve as a special fund for paying decentralized community rule writers.\n\nThe AAVE price is computed using the [Chainlink AAVE/USD price feed](https://etherscan.io/address/0x547a514d5e3769680Ce22B2361c10Ea13619e8a9) upon execution of the proposal.\n\nThe transactions that will be performed are as follows:\n1. Transfer a total worth of $900,000 in AAVE tokens from the EcosystemReserve to the ShortExecutor using the Ecosystem Reserve Controller contract at 0x1E506cbb6721B83B1549fa1558332381Ffa61A93.\n2. Approve $700,000 worth of AAVE tokens to Sablier.\n3. Create a Sablier stream with Certora as the beneficiary, to stream the $700,000 worth of Aave over 6 months.\n4. Transfer $200,000 worth of AAVE to a multisig co-controlled by Aave and Certora teams.\n5. Transfer USDC 1,000,000 from the Aave Collector to the ShortExecutor, first transfering aUSDC and then withdrawing them from the pool.\n6. Approve USDC 1,000,000 to Sablier.\n7. Create a Sablier stream with Certora as the beneficiary, to stream the USDC 1,000,000 over 6 months.\n\nThe source code for the proposal payload contract is available [here](https://github.com/Certora/aave-proposal-test).\nThe contract is deployed at [0x879A89D30b04b481Bcd54f474533d3D6A27cFd7D](https://etherscan.io/address/0x879a89d30b04b481bcd54f474533d3d6a27cfd7d).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\nOptimizing ETH rates on Aave v2 ethereum mainnet to meet the borrowing demands generated from the inclusion of stETH collateral.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the inclusion of new collateral type stETH the borrowing of ETH has increased to an all time high (4-6x more utilization) it is now critical to adjust rates to continue growth under current conditions.\n\nCurrently, stETH earns ~3.9% APR from staking rewards, while still being used as collateral in Aave, which allows users to go leverage on stETH while borrowing ETH. This is only sensible to do when ETH borrow rates are lower than stETH rewards. With the current interest modals the utilization has reached up to 19% (an all time high) and can grow further to about 24%. With the above updates it will allow utilization to go up to 70%. Yeilding good returns to users and a 3-4x increase in ETH revenue for the Aave protocol.\n\nFollow the forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/optimize-rate-curve-for-eth-improve-revenue-generation/7571) for more detailed description on calcualations, benefits & risks.\n\n## Specification\n\nProposed updated to ETH rates:\n\n- OPTIMAL_UTILIZATION_RATE = **70** (previously: 65)\n- EXCESS_UTILIZATION_RATE = **30** (previously: 35)\n- baseVariableBorrowRate = **0** (previously: 0)\n- variableRateSlope1 = **3** (previously: 8)\n- variableRateSlope2 = **100** (previously: 100)\n- stableRateSlope1 = **4** (previously: 10)\n- stableRateSlope2 = **100** (previously: 100)\n\n\n## Rationale\nCurrent stETH rewards are 4%. Staking rewards on ETH via Lido are still relatively high and stETH still has the capacity to accept another $4.5B of ETH. This increase in stETH supply would only reduce the rewards by 0.3%, meaning there is at least 1.5M ETH (~$4-5B USD) that could get staked. For Aave, it represents $4-5B in borrowings of ETH (more significant than any borrowing market that currently exists across any token)\n\n**Projected rates at current a 3% borrowing rate:**\n\n- Utilization: 24.5% [very low utilization leading to less revenue generation]\n- Borrowing rate: 3.02%\n- Supplying rate: 0.66% [low incentives for new lenders to come in]\n\n**Projected rates at 3% borrow rate and 70% utilization:**\n\n- Utilization: 70% [good revenue for governance]\n- Borrow rate: 3%\n- Supplying rate: 1.9% [decent for new lenders to come in or to get a discount for stable coin borrowing against ETH]\n\nSee Governance Post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/optimize-rate-curve-for-eth-improve-revenue-generation/7571) for more detailed description on calcualations, benefits & risks.\n\n## Implementation\n\n[Here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEc368D82cb2ad9fc5EfAF823B115A622b52bcD5F#code) is the new rate strategy.\n[Here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x49e4db0a4d63c73bae75747ee12ab63bbdda3207#code) is the execution payload.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

As of 3/28/2022, roughly 195M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdefa4e8a7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 57M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd974d5c2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There are currently $2.9M KNCL supplied and $900K total borrowed on Aave v2.\n\nConsidering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonus, LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2022-03-31/7742).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

This proposal recommends updating the Aave Arc market LTV parameter to match the LiquidationThreshold of the same asset listed on Aave mainnet v2 market. \nWe intend to re-propose a quarterly update of the risk parameters for the Aave Arc market quarterly in an attempt to keep both markets in sync with Aave mainnet v2 market, or Aave mainnet v3 once live.\n# Motivation\nThis risk parameter change is targeting the following improvements on the Aave Arc Market:\nAlign Risk Parameters - The risk parameters on Aave Arc market are currently more conservative and are in need of being updated to better reflect the Aave mainnet v2 market and also the risk profile of the user.\nImprove UX - Increasing LTV ratios and reducing the Liquidity Penalty enables greater capital efficiency across the market. \nGiven the extra precaution shown when approving Borrowers on the Aave Arc Market, the recommendation is to amend the LTV to reflect the risk profiles of market participants.

By partially funding the AGD with stablecoins, budgeting will be easier. The aUSDC will be funded through an approval and the AAVE will be funded with a transfer. Our initial proposal was made in May 2021 and our renewal proposal was made in November 2021.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave Grants DAO is a community-led grants program, focused on growing a thriving ecosystem of contributors within Aave through funding ideas, projects and events that benefit the ecosystem. We aim to drive development on top of Aave and ensure a constant influx of talented builders to maintain Aave’s long term growth. We help build culture and community around the Aave ecosystem that in turn attracts the best contributors.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThe full test of this proposal can be found here: https://github.com/llama-community/renew-aave-grants\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis proposal includes a $3M transfer of AAVE from the AaveEcosystemReserve to the grants DAO multisig and the AaveV2Collector approving $3M of aUSDC to the grants DAO multisig. This will allow the grants DAO to withdraw funds as needed and let the V2Collector to continue to earn interest in the meantime. The proposa payload will target the contract AaveEcosystemReserveController and call the function `function transfer(address collector, IERC20 token, address recipient, uint256 amount)` and `approve(address collector, IERC20 token, address recipient, uint256 amount)`.\n\n**Target Contracts**\n\nProposalPayload = [0x8e7df91fed22c192a3aa1bb6143879295ee91295](\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x8e7df91fed22c192a3aa1bb6143879295ee91295)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "## Simple Summary\n\nGauntlet proposes freezing UST on Aave v2, increasing liquidation threshold on stETH, and decreasing loan-to-value (LTV) on stETH.\n\n## Abstract\n\n\nDue to market conditions around UST and related oracle unreliability, Gauntlet proposes freezing UST.\n\nDue to current uncertainty around the stETH peg, Gauntlet proposes increasing stETH liquidation threshold to 81% and decreasing stETH LTV to 69%. Currently, stETH liquidation threshold is 75% and stETH LTV is 73%.\n\n## Specification\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OV5VRxV.png)\n\n\nDue to uncertainty around the stETH peg, Gauntlet proposes increasing stETH liquidation threshold. This will allow borrowers using stETH as collateral with more buffer in case stETH continues to depeg, and thus decrease the chances of liquidation cascades that lead to insolvency on the Aave platform. stETH LTV will also be decreased, so new positions will not be able to take on riskier positions using stETH as collateral. Our analysis indicates that an 81% liquidation threshold for stETH should allow for the protocol to withstand an additional 10% depeg from stETH and ETH price. Gauntlet's simulations of the Aave protocol indicated that a decrease in LTV to between 66-69% and an increase in liquidation threshold to 81-82% could significantly decrease liquidation volume as well as total insolvencies while minimally decreasing capital efficiency. \n\nOur simulations also considered larger increases in stETH's liquidation threshold, but these changes had a diminishing impact on liquidation and insolvency decreases in our models. Drastic changes to liquidation threshold can also lead to a negative user experience should protocol parameters be reversed to a more optimal state after the market returns to normal. However, a decrease in LTV only impacts a user's ability to borrow more assets and not deposit or repay debts, and thus won't affect user experience as heavily.\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/canceling-aip-74-freezing-ust-and-updating-steth-parameters/8154).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP is the combination of two ARCs presented on the Aave Governance Forum. This proposal performs the initial step of the [Llama treasury management strategy](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797) and also includes [Index Coop’s enable borrowing of DPI](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-enable-borrowing-of-dpi-on-aave-markets/6976) proposal. \n\nThe Llama proposal entails re-routing the current and future revenue from the mainnet V1 Reserve Factor to the mainnet V2 Reserve Factor. The Index Coop proposal re-enables users to borrow DPI after it was disable by [AIP-44](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/44-QmNVWrrm3ieyRRVD4f77zdxrvSUj1W4HDCojLKNcxmVQhr). \n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Llama Community recommends consolidating revenue earned on all Aave markets on mainnet into a single Reserve Factor (RF). This proposal consolidates past and future Aave mainnet V1 market revenue into the mainnet V2 RF. In the future, other aspects of the Llama treasury management proposal will be implemented through separate AIPs.\n\nThis proposal is broken into two parts, the second part is to enable borrowing of DPI. The borrowing of DPI was disabled via [AIP-44](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/44-QmNVWrrm3ieyRRVD4f77zdxrvSUj1W4HDCojLKNcxmVQhr) along with xSUSHI. Shortly after enacting AIP-44, DPI was found to be safe. This proposal is to reinstate DPI as an asset that can be borrowed on the Aave markets.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Part A - Consolidate Aave Mainnet V1and V2 Reserve Factors\n\nThe legacy V1 market continues to generate mostly flash loan fee revenue and this has slowed down in recent times. There is only ~$102.7M of TVL remaining in the V1 market, and at the rate of which revenue is generated is expected to continue declining as more and more users move to V2 or V3 over time. \n\nThis proposal recommends consolidating the Aave V1, V2, and AMM market revenue into a single location before deploying the capital to earn additional yield. The V1 RF holds around [~$435K](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae) of assets at the time of writing, whereas the Ethereum V2 + AMM market holds [$26.88M](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) of assets. Consolidating the RF balance would increase the mainnet treasury to around $27.32M.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Part A - Consolidate Aave Mainnet V1 and V2 Reserve Factors\n\nWithin this proposal, the assets held with the Aave mainnet V1 RF are to be transferred to the Aave mainnet V2 RF. All future revenue from the V1 deployment will now automatically accrue in the V2 RF upon implementation of this proposal. Post implementation of this proposal, the V1 RF is not expected to accrue any future revenue.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the consolidated constituents can be found on the [Aave Treasury Finances by Llama Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60).\n\n### Part B - Enable Borrowing DPI\n\nThe recommendation is to enable borrowing and although there are a number of extrinsic use cases for DPI emerging, starting with a utilisation rate of 45%. For Variable Interest Rate parameters, a Base of 0, Slope 1 of 7% and Slope 2 of 300% was selected which is similar to the constituents within DPI. At this point in time, there is no ask for Stable Interest Rate borrowing. \n\nThe details outlining the original specification for listing DPI can be found here, [AIP-31](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/27-Qme2d9yZ81j3JkQ4ecr7BSZv4Rvh5NyU36um48f5S75CQG). For any additional information see Index Coop’s website: https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThe full test of this proposal can be found here: https://github.com/llama-community/refactor-aave-rf/\n\n## Implementation\n\nAave mainnet V1 Reserve Factor: `0xE3d9988F676457123C5fD01297605efdD0Cba1ae`\nAave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor: `0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c`\n\nBy calling `function execute()` and `function distributeTokens()` on the ProposalPayload contract, the token distributor will be upgraded to send all funds to the `Aave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor`, the AAVE protocol v1's token distributor will be set to `Aave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor`, DPI borrowing will be enabled and all large balances from the `Aave mainnet V1 Reserve Factor` will be distributed to `Aave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor`.

      "description": "\n\n## Summary\n\nAdd a `claimRewardsToSelf()` function to the liquidity mining incentives contract, so a caller can claim their own rewards without specifying the `to` recipient.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAave incentive contracts currently only contain claiming functions in which the caller specifies the recipient `to` address, who will receive the claimed rewards. Unfortunately, this poses a security problem for abstractly-designed smart contract claimants that do not have fully-trusted originators of claiming txs. This is the case for Enzyme vaults. By adding an additional claiming function to the incentive contract that uses `msg.sender` instead of `to`, the tx originator no longer needs to be trusted.\n\nThis simple addition - that reuses the exact same claiming logic as the current claiming functions with no changes to storage layout - will increase composability opportunities with Enzyme and similarly architected protocols.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEnzyme is a decentralised asset management infrastructure built on Ethereum. It allows asset managers to build on-chain investment Vaults that utilise and allocate to the newest innovations in DeFi. Because all transactions occur on the Ethereum blockchain, compliance, accounting, and investor management services are rendered programatically and at a dramatically-reduced cost to their traditional finance counterparts.\n\nAmongst other things, Enzyme Vaults can interact with AAVE by lending. We are currently also working on accommodating the borrowing functionality to enable leveraged strategies.\n\nIn order to keep providing our users with superior asset management tools in DeFi, we want to open up the liquidity mining option for them as soon as possible. Our users rely on having the latest DeFi functionality in Enzyme to reach their full potential.\n\nBenefits for AAVE:\n\n- Increased AAVE adoption by the Enzyme user base and other similarly architected protocols\n- Tapping into a new and fast-growing community\n- A closer collaboration between our two projects & communities\n- Enzyme contracts have been audited by PWC, Chain Security and some of the leading auditors in the space who sit on the Enzyme Council\n- Opening up the possibility for new and novel use-cases to be built around AAVE\n\n## Specification\n\nAdds `function claimRewardsToSelf(address[] calldata assets, uint256 amount)` to the liquidity mining incentives contract, which reuses the logic of `claimRewards()` but uses `msg.sender` instead of `to`.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis is the simplest, least intrusive way to support claimants who might not be trusted to send claimed rewards to a third party.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nTest suites (local, mainnet fork, and proposal flow on mainnet fork) have been included at https://github.com/aave/incentives-controller/pull/4 and have been reviewed by Aave team.\n\n## Implementation\n\nFull PR: https://github.com/aave/incentives-controller/pull/4\n\nNew incentives implementation contract on Ethereum mainnet: `0xD9ED413bCF58c266F95fE6BA63B13cf79299CE31`\n\nUpgrade to be executed via deployment of `ProposalIncentivesV2Executor.sol`: https://github.com/aave/incentives-controller/blob/e5e8b2c994ee29b0af883db7c94add372b4423b2/contracts/proposals/ProposalIncentivesV2Executor.sol\n\nDeployed proposal payload (`ProposalIncentivesV2Executor.sol`) on Ethereum mainnet: `0xb8fA635fEC4E6BDb05e7937cBeF01214991e9D5a`\n\n## Audit\n\nhttps://github.com/aave/incentives-proposal/blob/1ef7705546dc7970795003e435f76b73efebbb1d/audits/Enzyme_Aave_IncentivesController_Improvement.pdf\n\n## Snapshot vote\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmcgTovk982fcUTN17qtDyZ4oCoVGnKZJGuwMVtqspfphk\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8mjJOKb.png)\n\n\n## Aave Arc (Fireblocks) Parameter Changes Specification\n\nOur simulation platform indicates that increasing the capital efficiency of USDC collateral does not meaningfully increase the risk of insolvencies. Note that, on our dashboard, the Value at Risk (VaR) metric for Aave Arc is currently $0. This low risk of insolvencies is reflective of the fact that the majority of borrowing on the platform is collateralized by the same asset as the assets being borrowed. As lending market usage grows, our platform will continue to ingest up-to-date data, re-run risk simulations, and make future parameter change recommendations.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hUTDeJU.png)\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\n\n### Aave V2 Dashboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Vdil33O.png)\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonus, LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-and-aave-arc-fireblocks-2022-05-26/8299).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*<sup>By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.<sup>*\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis is a copy of [Proposal 76](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/76/) ([IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaqqGyP76hDi5ywqSoF5r63jVrG7TdZVNzcm8Zdwa4PeM)). It expired before execution so we need to re-propose it to the Aave community.\n\nThis AIP is the combination of two ARCs presented on the Aave Governance Forum. This proposal performs the initial step of the [Llama treasury management strategy](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797) and also includes [Index Coop’s enable borrowing of DPI](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-enable-borrowing-of-dpi-on-aave-markets/6976) proposal. \n\nThe Llama proposal entails re-routing the current and future revenue from the mainnet V1 Reserve Factor to the mainnet V2 Reserve Factor. The Index Coop proposal re-enables users to borrow DPI after it was disable by [AIP-44](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/44-QmNVWrrm3ieyRRVD4f77zdxrvSUj1W4HDCojLKNcxmVQhr). \n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Llama Community recommends consolidating revenue earned on all Aave markets on mainnet into a single Reserve Factor (RF). This proposal consolidates past and future Aave mainnet V1 market revenue into the mainnet V2 RF. In the future, other aspects of the Llama treasury management proposal will be implemented through separate AIPs.\n\nThis proposal is broken into two parts, the second part is to enable borrowing of DPI. The borrowing of DPI was disabled via [AIP-44](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/44-QmNVWrrm3ieyRRVD4f77zdxrvSUj1W4HDCojLKNcxmVQhr) along with xSUSHI. Shortly after enacting AIP-44, DPI was found to be safe. This proposal is to reinstate DPI as an asset that can be borrowed on the Aave markets.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Part A - Consolidate Aave Mainnet V1and V2 Reserve Factors\n\nThe legacy V1 market continues to generate mostly flash loan fee revenue and this has slowed down in recent times. There is only ~$102.7M of TVL remaining in the V1 market, and at the rate of which revenue is generated is expected to continue declining as more and more users move to V2 or V3 over time. \n\nThis proposal recommends consolidating the Aave V1, V2, and AMM market revenue into a single location before deploying the capital to earn additional yield. The V1 RF holds around [~$435K](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae) of assets at the time of writing, whereas the Ethereum V2 + AMM market holds [$26.88M](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) of assets. Consolidating the RF balance would increase the mainnet treasury to around $27.32M.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Part A - Consolidate Aave Mainnet V1 and V2 Reserve Factors\n\nWithin this proposal, the assets held with the Aave mainnet V1 RF are to be transferred to the Aave mainnet V2 RF. All future revenue from the V1 deployment will now automatically accrue in the V2 RF upon implementation of this proposal. Post implementation of this proposal, the V1 RF is not expected to accrue any future revenue.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the consolidated constituents can be found on the [Aave Treasury Finances by Llama Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60).\n\n### Part B - Enable Borrowing DPI\n\nThe recommendation is to enable borrowing and although there are a number of extrinsic use cases for DPI emerging, starting with a utilisation rate of 45%. For Variable Interest Rate parameters, a Base of 0, Slope 1 of 7% and Slope 2 of 300% was selected which is similar to the constituents within DPI. At this point in time, there is no ask for Stable Interest Rate borrowing. \n\nThe details outlining the original specification for listing DPI can be found here, [AIP-31](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/27-Qme2d9yZ81j3JkQ4ecr7BSZv4Rvh5NyU36um48f5S75CQG). For any additional information see Index Coop’s website: https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThe full test of this proposal can be found here: https://github.com/llama-community/refactor-aave-rf/\n\n## Implementation\n\nAave mainnet V1 Reserve Factor: `0xE3d9988F676457123C5fD01297605efdD0Cba1ae`\nAave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor: `0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c`\n\nBy calling `function execute()` and `function distributeTokens()` on the ProposalPayload contract, the token distributor will be upgraded to send all funds to the `Aave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor`, the AAVE protocol v1's token distributor will be set to `Aave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor`, DPI borrowing will be enabled and all large balances from the `Aave mainnet V1 Reserve Factor` will be distributed to `Aave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor`.

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nLlama proposes listing CVX, the governance token of the Convex Finance protocol, on Aave v2 mainnet as collateral with borrowing enabled. The risk parameters detailed within have been provided by Gauntlet.\n\n## Abstract\n\nConvex Finance allows Curve.fi liquidity providers to earn trading fees, CVX liquidity mining and boosted CRV rewards without having to lock and use their boosting power with veCRV. Convex Finance intends to add support for other tokens like FXS in the future.\n\nListing CVX on Aave v2 will enable lenders to receive yield and borrowers of CVX to partake in Convex Finance’s tokenomics model to earn yield. As CVX has a different, but similar tokenomics model to CRV, Llama expects there to be similar demand for CVX. aCRV is one of the highest earning assets on Aave v2 and Llama hopes CVX will become a significant source of revenue for the community.\n\nThe Aave community also benefits from being able to use the aCVX revenue to participate in Convex Finance’s tokenomics and vote CRV rewards to Curve pools that contain aTokens.\n\n## Motivation\n\nListing CVX on the Aave V2 market would allow Aave to benefit from the first mover advantage as CVX is not currently listed on any major lending market. This asset listing has the potential to be a meaningful high vol asset revenue source. CRV is currently the fifth highest earning asset on the Aave V2 Market and has generated 190.33k aCRV tokens in revenue worth around [$744k](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) at the time of writing.\n\nIn addition to the lending and borrowing demand, the aCVX revenue can be used to support directing CRV and CVX incentives distribution to those who stake Curve Liquidity Provider tokens on Convex Finance.

Threshold to 90%, Pause ETH Borrowing\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nMitigate risk to Aave v2 markets relating to the price deviation of stETH/ETH.\n\n## Abstract\n\n[Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/staked-eth-and-aave-risk-june-11th-update/8469)\n\nstETH has emerged over recent months as one of the most popular collateral types on AAVE. Many users have deposited stETH and borrowed ETH against it. This means that if those prices diverge or the asset “depegs”, there could be a lot of liquidations in AAVE. There has been much speculation on the risks posed by a stETH/ETH price depeg on the protocol. This proposal follows up on our [last post](https://governance.aave.com/t/canceling-aip-74-freezing-ust-and-updating-steth-parameters/8154) to provide further risk mitigation actions.\n\nStarting June 10, Gauntlet observed a large spike in AAVE VaR due to volatility in stETH price and immediately investigated it further. The following steps mitigate the chance of a liquidation spiral negatively impacting AAVE tokenholders and users.\n\n\n1. Freeze the stETH market\n\nThis will prevent new positions from being opened. This will temporarily pause the stETH market except for people winding down their positions. This is essential as it allows us to take the next step, increasing the liquidation threshold (LT) for ETH. If we don’t pause the market, users could increase the risk by opening new positions that take advantage of the increased LT.\n\n2. Increase LT for stETH to 90%\n\nThis will give existing positions more breathing room with regards to stETH/ETH price deviation (you can the see effect of this in the heatmaps above) and will make the protocol much more resilient to a further depeg.\n\n3. Pause ETH borrowing\n\nIf LT is changed, then preventing existing positions from increasing their risk exposure is required. To do this, you would need to prevent new ETH borrows from being opened. Almost all ETH borrowing is recursive borrowing and so while there is limited demand for ETH borrow, it’s still something users want.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal implements its changes by calling configureReserveAsCollateral, freezeReserve, and disableBorrowingOnReserve on the LendingPoolConfigurator contract at 0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756, using the address and parameters specific to each token and each parameter update.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n\nBy approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.\n",

      "description": "## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP proposes adjusting two (2) total risk parameters, including LTV and Liquidation Threshold, across one (1) Aave Arc (Fireblocks) asset. \n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. \n\nThese parameter updates represent Gauntlet's first set of parameter updates for the Aave Arc market.\n\nThese parameter updates were proposed in [AIP 81](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/81/). The vote was unanimously YAE but did not reach quorum. As such, Gauntlet re-proposes these updates in this AIP.\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\n\n## Aave Arc (Fireblocks) Parameter Changes Specification\n\nOur simulation platform indicates that increasing the capital efficiency of USDC collateral does not meaningfully increase the risk of insolvencies. Note that, on our dashboard, the Value at Risk (VaR) metric for Aave Arc is currently $0. This low risk of insolvencies is reflective of the fact that the majority of borrowing on the platform is collateralized by the same asset as the assets being borrowed. As lending market usage grows, our platform will continue to ingest up-to-date data, re-run risk simulations, and make future parameter change recommendations.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hUTDeJU.png)\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk.\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-and-aave-arc-fireblocks-2022-05-26/8299).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe Aave DAO is to perform a token swap with Balancer DAO. The Aave DAO is to acquire 200,000 BAL tokens for 16907.28 AAVE tokens based on a 90 day moving average exchange rate of 1 AAVE for 11.8292250604 BAL tokens. \n\nUpon completion of the transaction the BAL tokens will be received into the mainnet Reserve Factor (RF).\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP only performs the very first step in creating a veBAL holding for the Aave DAO. This AIP performs only the token swap with Balancer by exchanging AAVE from the Ecosystem Reserve for 200,000 BAL tokens.\n\nThis is the initial transaction that will then allow for the 200,000 BAL tokens plus the aBAL tokens in the Reserve Factor (redeemed for BAL) are to be paired with sufficient ETH and deposited into the Balancer V2 BAL:ETH (80:20) pool. The B-80BAL-20WETH Liquidity Provider position will then be locked up for 1 year. \n\nInitially, the veBAL will be used to vote BAL rewards to pools which support aTokens that create TVL for Aave and/or AAVE liquidity pools.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave and Balancer have a long history of working together. The AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool BPT is accepted within the Aave Safe Module and the newly created Balancer Boosted Pools drive TVL to Aave markets, [1](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc697051d1c6296c24ae3bcef39aca743861d9a81/).\n\nWhen the AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool is moved to Balancer V2 and integrated into Aave’s Safety Module, the veBAL tokens can be used to vote BAL rewards to the newly created AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V2 pool.\n\nIn addition, the veBAL can be used to vote BAL rewards to Balancer Boosted Pools which utilise Aave markets in the background to create yield for passively held liquidity, [2](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe). There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using veBAL to vote for BAL rewards to pools that strengthen Aave is a strategic advantage of deploying the BAL tokens into the BAL:ETH pool.\n\nBy exchanging AAVE for BAL, the tokenswap reflects the ongoing collaboration and shared vision through governance in each other’s community. The token exchange is significant enough for Aave to become just outside of the Top 50 BAL tokens holder, based on etherscan BAL holder rankings, [3](https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#balances). Balancer will become a Top 80 AAVE holder, [4](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9#balances). Each community will have influence in the other’s governance process, enabling them to best represent their interests and to collaborate.\n\nAave will likely be one of the first movers in the upcoming BAL wars and will gain a strategic advantage to bootstrap new Balancer Boosted Pools which lead to tokens being deposited in Aave markets to earn yield. This has the benefit of creating TVL and Revenue for Aave.\n\nThe initial sizing to acquire 200,000 BAL was something that was reached via discussions with the Balancer community and happens to be the same size as the recent Tribe DAO and Balancer token swap, [5](https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-33-swap-between-balancer-dao-and-fei-dao/3555).\n\n\n## Test Cases\n\n* The full test of the Proposal Payload can be found here: https://github.com/llama-community/aave-balancer-swap\n* The full test of the Swap contract can be found here: https://github.com/llama-community/bal-aave-token-swap\n\n## Implementation\n\nCode Implementation of the OTC swap contract and AAVE proposal payload for AAVE Governance : https://github.com/llama-community/aave-balancer-swap\n\nThe full implementation consists of 4 steps:\n1. Deploy the Swap contract (`OtcEscrowApprovals`). The Swap contract contains a `swap()` function that trustlessly executes a token swap between the AAVE Ecosystem Reserve + AAVE Mainnet Reserve Factor and Balancer treasury for the pre-determined and pre-approved token amounts.\n2. Balancer treasury approves the Swap contract to transfer the 200,000 BAL tokens on its behalf.\n3. Deploy the Proposal Payload contract (`ProposalPayload`). \n4. The Proposal Payload contract contains an `execute()` function that:\n* Approves the Swap contract contract through the AAVE Ecosystem Reserve Controller to transfer 16907.28 AAVE from the AAVE Ecosystem Reserve. \n* Calls the `swap()` function on the Swap contract to execute the swap. \n\nSteps 1, 2 and 3 are intended to be pre-requisites to the actual implementation of this proposal which is Step 4.\n\n**Deployed Contracts**\n* OtcEscrowApprovals = [0x5AE986d7ca23fc3519daaa589E1d38d19BA42a47](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ae986d7ca23fc3519daaa589e1d38d19ba42a47)\n* ProposalPayload = [0xc730008C64783a283988b0fA3b5eE6b6F997922A](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc730008c64783a283988b0fa3b5ee6b6f997922a)\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

To date, and despite the large TVL potentially attracting a lot of malicious actors, Aave users haven’t suffered any losses due to smart contract bugs or vulnerabilities. Lately, it has been increasingly difficult to contract reputable smart contract security auditors, as most of the prominent firms in this space are booked out for months.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal authorises payment of the minimum engagement fee outlined in [the proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/sigma-prime-security-assessment-services-for-aave/8518) (US$ 1,296,000) through the following:\n- Upfront payment for 50% of the minimum engagement fee (US$ 648,000) paid in aUSDC and aUSDT (even split, $324,000 each)\n- Remaining 50% (US$ 648,000) paid at the end of the engagement period (12 months) via two (2) payment streams in aUSDC and aUSDT (even split, $324,000 each), with each stream starting 12 months from now, and lasting a duration of 1 second.\n\nIf the maximum fee was to apply to this engagement, a subsequent proposal will be pushed forward for the remaining amount in 12 months (i.e at the end of the engagement period).\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nSigma Prime is an information security consultancy who specialise in Blockchain technology and administered from Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe primary focus of Sigma Prime is to help secure distributed systems through in-depth security assessments of decentralised projects, while concurrently researching and developing core Blockchain infrastructure. Over the past 6 years, we have been working with some of the most prominent organisations in the space: the Ethereum Foundation, Chainlink, SushiSwap, 1inch, the Filecoin Foundation, NEAR, Arbitrum, Lido, Rocket Pool, and plenty of others.\n\nSigma Prime is also the founder and maintainer of the Lighthouse project, an open-source implementation of the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake Consensus specification, written in Rust. Lighthouse is one of the leading Ethereum consensus client implementations and has a particular focus on performance and security.\n\nThroughout the works performed for Aave, the feedback received from the leadership team has been highly positive. Sigma Prime has gained a high degree of familiarity with the protocol, which will be leveraged as required for the delivery of this engagement.\n\n## Test Cases\n\n- Please refer to the [test section](https://github.com/sigp/sigp-aip-payload/tree/master/test) of the [sigp/sigp-aip-payload](https://github.com/sigp/sigp-aip-payload) repository.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- [PayloadAaveSigP](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe8ea74754dce51168102e820424f7e7f74c5be3e#code)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nLlama proposes listing 1INCH, the governance token of the 1inch Network, on Aave v2 mainnet as collateral with borrowing enabled. The risk parameters detailed within have been provided by Gauntlet. \n\n## Abstract\n\n1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol v1.

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nSecuritize asks the Aave Governance community to approve the appointment, adoption, and authorization of Securitize as a “whitelister” on the Aave Arc market.\n\n## Abstract\n\nSecuritize is the leading digital asset securities company. As a FINRA member Broker-Dealer and the first SEC-registered Transfer Agent operating with digital asset securities, Securitize is one of the most regulated firms in the entire digital assets industry.\n\nSecuritize has an excellent track record for providing comprehensive compliance services to a vast array of digital assets companies. Our proprietary investor passport, Securitize iD, is globally recognized and built upon Securitize’s battle-tested KYC/KYB/AML/CFT compliance program, allowing Securitize iD to be trusted by over 450K registered investors and over 200 issuers to date.\n\nWe have performed a detailed analysis and documented it [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-appoint-securitize-as-a-whitelister-to-aave-arc/6434) for the consideration of the Aave Governance community. We believe that Securitize satisfies all criteria necessary to be appointed as a whitelister for Aave Arc.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe institutional appetite for DeFi is growing, but that hunger remains mostly unsatisfied due to compliance obstacles. In response, pragmatic DeFi communities like Aave launched permissioned versions of their services, like Aave Arc, and are wisely seeking regulated third parties, like Securitize, to facilitate user credential and access management.\n\nAs a whitelister, Securitize will function as one of the trusted gatekeepers for Aave Arc, ensuring that only wallets with verified credentials can access the permissioned liquidity pool. Therefore, institutions can safely leverage the transactional benefits of Aave — e.g., supply, borrow, and liquidate digital assets — while still abiding by their compliance requirements. Securitize believes that this is a monumental first step toward the eventual mass inclusion of institutions in the decentralized economy.\n\n## Specification\n\n“Whitelisting” is the gatekeeping function performed by whitelisters on users of Aave Arc. The term refers specifically to the process of:\n\nConducting KYC/KYB checks on the user;\nOnboarding the user with appropriate disclosures, terms, and conditions;\nGranting specific permissions (e.g., borrow, supply, liquidate) to the Ethereum wallet address(es) provided by the user.\nIn addition, Aave Arc whitelisters perform a similar role on Arc as guardians do on Aave V2. Specifically, whitelisters can use a multi-sig veto on governance proposals that add excessive compliance risk on the Aave Arc protocol. For example, existing whitelisters can veto the addition of a privacy coin if such a coin is impermissible in the relevant jurisdiction, or veto the addition of a whitelister that has a poor reputation for compliance.\n\nThe whitelisting is managed via a [PermissionManager](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE) contract, in which whitelisters are designated as Permission Admins. Permission Admins are permitted to add or remove wallets grants to the Aave Arc market by calling addPermissions() and removePermissions() contract methods, respectively.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Aave Governance community voted on the Snapshot proposal with “YES” 389K AAVE (99.98%) and “No” 87 AAVE (0.02%)\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe implementation is described [here](https://github.com/aave/arc-timelock#adding-a-new-permissionadmin)\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe proposal executes a single call to the PermissionManager contract to add [Securitize](https://etherscan.io/address/0x36b8A1D23BDc76092aD88A1c4Ef59fafD4931b03) as PermissionAdmin in Aave ARC market:\n`IPermissionManager(0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE).addPermissionAdmins([0x36b8A1D23BDc76092aD88A1c4Ef59fafD4931b03]);`\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "description": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust seven (7) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across four (4) Aave V2 assets. \n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for CRV and ENJ.** The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. \n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zW3mXLO.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6AnD7kE.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/L5VsbrR.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Top CRV non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8RwGtti.png)\n\n**Top DAI non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xo6pCby.png)\n\n**Top ENJ non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3SOtHAm.png)\n\n**Top LINK non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5wxtQRV.png)\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| **CRV Liquidation Threshold**    | 65%     | ***64%***     |\n| DAI Liquidation Threshold     | 80%     | 85%     |\n| DAI Liquidation Bonus    | 5.0%     | 4.0%     |\n| **ENJ Liquidation Threshold**     | 70%     | ***67%***     |\n| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 6.5%     | 6.0%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Threshold     | 78%     | 83%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Bonus    | 6.3%     | 7.0%     |\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 07/01 to 08/03. These are valuable metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. \n\n|Symbol| 08-03 Volatility| 07-01 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |\n| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |\n| CRV   | \t  1.47619713      |  1.778618025  | \t\t-0.302420895   |  77.315888   |\n| DAI    |  \t0.039068386     |   0.259962179   | \t-0.220893793    |  -50.4644256 |\n| ENJ    |   1.148617699     |  1.452206402      | -0.303588703|  \t25.9940047  |\n| LINK    |   0.910394357     |  1.650882468      | -0.740488111  |  \t23.1053197  |\n\n\n## Notable Accounts to Flag\n\nAs of 8/8/2022, the data shows that no accounts would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on the forum post.\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n### Aave V2 Dashboard\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KkfStOO.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonus, LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-and-aave-arc-fireblocks-2022-08-04/9197).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is non-custodial. All MAI is backed by collateral locked in user-managed vaults. MAI minting is available on 8 chains, and bridging to 18 chains.\n\nAll accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds. MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns.\n\nThere’s around 250M MAI minted, with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present. A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve. MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon.\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\nV3 Efficiency mode: stablecoins\nV3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor, $2M initial debt ceiling per chain\n\n## Specifications\n**What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nCore team at QiDao Protocol.\n\n**Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**\n\nMAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon. It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0% interest.\n\nMAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Harmony, Moonriver, and Gnosis Chain. MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi, currently on 18 chains through Multichain. Accepted collateral includes interest-bearing assets like Aave Market Tokens. Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI - instead, they are charged a 0.5% fee upon repayment.\n\nDespite market downturns during its existence, MAI has maintained its peg.\n\nMAI currently has a TVL of around $90M, and has around 70M MAI outstanding.\n\n**Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nBeing the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom, MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains. Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI.\nMAI is one of the most crosschain assets, available on 18 chains through canonical bridging. As a result, users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has.\n\nMAI’s risk profile is low. It is used by large institutions. MAI has also received grants from several blockchains, including Polygon, Metis, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Gnosis.\n\n**Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nMAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol, a community-run DAO around the QI token.\nSeveral other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing, including Frax Finance, Stake DAO, Celsius, * PolygonDAO, SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Gotchi Vault, and Beefy Finance\nThe Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao.\n\n**How is the asset currently used?**\n\nLending (Market.xyz, Impermax, Tarot)\nListed on several DEXs on 18 chains. Main DEXs are Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Solidly, Saber, and TombSwap\nTop two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon\nMAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM\nMAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties\nMAI offers low-cost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO, Yearn, Beefy, and Aave\n\n**Emission schedule**\n\nUsers can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0% interest. Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation.\n\n**Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.**\n\n**Is there a multisig? What can it do?

      "description": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. \n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for CRV.** The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n\n**Top 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive aggregate positions**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wNwliie.png)\n\n**Top 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive borrowers' entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1t6xx1J.png)\n\n**Top 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive borrowers' entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AZIyE4A.png)\n\n\n\n\n**Top CRV non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pggzt0r.png)\n\n**Top DAI non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HBehpt2.png)\n\n**Top WBTC non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QHwW1K2.png)\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| **CRV Liquidation Threshold**    | 64%     | ***61%***     |\n| CRV Liquidation Bonus    | 8.5%     | 8.0%     |\n| DAI Liquidation Threshold     | 85%     | 90%     |\n| WBTC Liquidation Threshold     | 75%     | 80%     |\n| WBTC Liquidation Bonus    | 6.5%     | 5.0%     |\n\n\n## Notable Accounts to Flag\n\nAs of 8/18/2022, the data shows that no accounts would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on the forum post.\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n### Aave V2 Dashboard\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pD6AJx9.png)\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonus, LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-and-aave-arc-fireblocks-2022-08-18/9367).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nAdd LUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave (0% LTV), helping the protocol diversify its stablecoin offering away from centralized stablecoins.\n\n## Abstract\n\nLUSD is stablecoin minted directly by the protocol users by opening a Trove and depositing ETH as collateral. Loans are interest-free, with a 0.5% base initiation fee. All the contracts of the Liquity protocol are immutable, which makes LUSD the most trustless stablecoin currently available on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nLUSD is overcollateralized by ETH with two main mechanisms helping it keep its peg: first, LUSD can be redeemed for ETH at face value (i.e., 1 LUSD for $1 of ETH). Secondly, there is a minimal collateral ratio of 110%. Both mechanisms respectively create a price floor and ceiling through arbitrage opportunities.\n\nSince the protocol is immutable, no additional developments are planned, yet the Liquity team is working on another project that will prove synergetic with LUSD.\n\nLUSD’s resilience makes it a highly sought-after stablecoin for DAOs and protocols looking to diversify their treasury and users looking for cost-effective leverage on ETH. The current focus is to grow the DeFi ecosystem around LUSD to enable more diverse use cases.\n\n## Motivation\n\nMost of the stablecoins available for borrowing on Aave are centralized or relying heavily on centralized collateral, apart from FEI, sUSD and RAI. Adding LUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave would enable the protocol to further diversify away from centralized stablecoins.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal initialises the LUSD reserve, enables variable borrowing and sets a reserve factor. As needed, it also connects a price source on the AaveOracle.\n\n## Rationale\n\nLUSD will be added as a borrowable asset only (0% LTV) to ensure the safest onboarding possible. If the demand for borrowing is sufficient, the LTV could later be raised and once mainnet v3 is available, efficiency mode could also be enabled. \n\n## Test Cases\n\nAll the components involved in this proposal (tokens' implementations, interest rate strategy, oracle feed, proposal payload) have been tested and reviewed, including simulations on mainnet of the whole proposal lifecycle.\n\nLink to Test Cases: [End-to-end test suite](https://github.com/liquity/example-aave-v2-listing/blob/master/src/test/ValidationLUSDListing.sol)\n\n## Implementation\n\n- [LUSDListingPayload](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe0070f7a961dcb102e3d904a170613be3f3b37a9)\n- [aLUSD implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x893E606358205AD994e610ad48e8aEF98aEadDbe)\n- [Variable Debt LUSD implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEB1cfEF24F5B9d287F702AC6EbD301E606936B54)\n- [Stable Debt LUSD implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x595c33538215DC4B092F35Afc85d904631263f4F)\n- [Interest rate strategy for LUSD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x545Ae1908B6F12e91E03B1DEC4F2e06D0570fE1b)\n- [LusdUsdToLusdEth price feed](https://etherscan.io/address/0x60c0b047133f696334a2b7f68af0b49d2F3D4F72)\n- [LUSD token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f98805A4E8be255a32880FDeC7F6728C6568bA0)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

As a result, FEI will become backed 1:1 with DAI and redeemable 1FEI:1DAI. With Tribe DAO transitioning into a terminal state, the FEI stablecoin will overtime be redeemed for DAI.\n\nAs FEI is redeemed for DAI, over time FEI’s circulating supply and liquidity will fall away.

High utilization interferes with liquidation transactions, thus increasing the chances of insolvency for the protocol. In addition, a high ETH borrow rate can make stETH/ETH recursive positions unprofitable, increasing the chances that users unwind their positions and drive the stETH/ETH price deviation further, causing additional liquidations and insolvency.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n* Calling `disableBorrowingOnReserve` to disable ETH borrowing.\n* Sending 60 AAVE to the MakerDAO pause proxy located at `0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB` from the ecosystem reserve.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nWe propose that the Aave DAO retribute a total of $16.28M in retroactive funding to Aave Companies for development of Aave Protocol V3. This total includes $15M for work performed directly by the team over the course of more than one year and \\$1.28M for costs paid to third-party audit services.\n\n## Abstract\n\nFollowing the successful launch of V3 of the Aave Protocol, this Aave Request for Comment (ARC) seeks community feedback and validation for a governance proposal to the Aave DAO seeking retroactive funding for the development and deployment of V3 by the Aave Companies.\n\nAave V3 provided enhanced features to the Aave Protocol based on community feedback, solving limitations in V2 while pushing important new features to the forefront of the protocol and contributing to the overall success and strength of the Aave ecosystem.\n\nSome of the important new features include:\n\n- New modes such as the High Efficiency Mode and Isolation Mode which allow for increased capital efficiency whilst limiting risks for the protocol.\n- Risk Management Improvements providing additional protection to the protocol through risk caps and other tools.\n- L2-Specific features which improve user experience and reliability.\n- Portal, which allows assets to seamlessly flow between Aave V3 markets over different networks\n\nWe propose that the Aave DAO retribute $15 million (incurred work) and $1.28 million (audit) to the Aave Companies to retroactively fund the development of V3. This funding request covers work done by members of the Aave Companies over the course of more than a year.\n\nThe full proposal can be found here: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-retroactive-funding/9250\n\n## Motivation\n\n### **Introduction**\n\n![Introduction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aave/aip/Pending-AIPs/content/assets/a22882572b3f-AIP-V3-RETROACTIVE-FUNDING/introimage.png)\n\nA focus on risk management and capital efficiency and a contemporaneous reinforcement of the flexibility and decentralization of the protocol has been instrumental in the success of Aave V3.\n\nAligned with [Vitalik’s take on retroactive public goods funding](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) —it’s easier to agree on what was useful than what will be useful—the benefit of hindsight allows the community to make an accurate and fair quantification of the work done on V3 against the backdrop of V3’s post-launch success, as well as the potential for V3 moving forward.\n\nThis ARC follows this logic, seeking retroactive funding for the work that went into V3, which allows the community to view V3’s success since its launch, as noted in the [initial proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-aave-v3/6035): “The community will also be able to decide whether to provide retroactive funding to those who contributed to the creation of V3, and how much funding to provide.”\n\n### **Context: Decentralization and Incentivizing Contributors**\n\nIt is imperative that the Aave protocol ecosystem remains as decentralized as possible. This is why contributors to the Aave protocol such as BGD Labs, Certora, SigmaPrime, Llama and Gauntlet have been able to build sustainable businesses within the Aave ecosystem. By working on the protocol, interacting with governance, and collaborating, all these different contributors add to the decentralized space.\n\nContributors interact with the protocol and the DAO in a symbiotic circle, as demonstrated in the diagram below:\n\n![circle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aave/aip/Pending-AIPs/content/assets/a22882572b3f-AIP-V3-RETROACTIVE-FUNDING/circle.jpeg)\n\nEach part of this symbiotic circle is integral to the whole. Contributors help to develop the protocol and ensure that protocol revenue continues to grow in a sustainable manner. Innovations and contributions help attract more users by improving user experience and developing new products and services. Protocol revenue, in part, then gets redirected to the DAO; bolstering the DAO treasury to continue fuelling innovations in the Aave ecosystem.\n\nThe DAO has the ability to fund contributors within the ecosystem, spurring further innovation and ensuring that contributors can operate successfully in this environment. This incentivizes groups to continue to build, in turn contributing efforts that benefit the Aave community and the cycle continues.\n\nTherefore, for the Aave Protocol to continue to develop, contributors need to be able to build and sustain successful businesses through decentralized funding methods within the ecosystem.\n\n### Aave Companies as a Contributor\n\nThe revenue created across versions of the Aave Protocol adds to the sustainability of the DAO, facilitating the funding of a variety of contributors within the ecosystem through various types of cryptoassets.\n\nWith request, permission and support granted by the Aave DAO, the Aave Companies have been an important contributor for the protocol, alongside others such as BGD Labs, Gauntlet, Certora, SigmaPrime, Llama and others. We have been building exciting innovations within the Aave ecosystem and want to continue doing so. A brief overview of this work that has taken place over many years is visualized in the simple diagram below:\n\n![timeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aave/aip/Pending-AIPs/content/assets/a22882572b3f-AIP-V3-RETROACTIVE-FUNDING/timeline.jpeg)\n\nAs the Aave protocol has grown into what it is today, costs associated with development have risen substantially. For example, security has always been a cornerstone of protocol development, and this has become more crucial as Aave’s TVL has increased. Building an innovative, secure and battle-tested version of a protocol such as Aave V3 requires experienced builders across a variety of skill sets that are fairly compensated for their work.\n\n### **V3’s Technological Advancements and Success**\n\nIn 2019, the first version of the Aave Protocol smart contracts was deployed on Ethereum. Users were able to obtain and provide liquidity and earn yield on the liquidity they provided. In 2021, V2 of the Aave Protocol saw new features such as credit delegation, debt tokenization, and optimized gas costs. V2 established the Aave Protocol as a DeFi primitive, substantially growing the community and ecosystem.\n\nWhilst V2 provided a solid foundation, through community feedback, it became clear that to scale the Aave Protocol, capital efficiency and risk management would need to be central to the protocol’s functionalities.\n\nAave V3 therefore iterates on the previous versions, solving limitations present in V2 while pushing innovative features to the forefront of the protocol. Here are just a few of these features and improvements:\n\n- High Efficiency Mode allows borrowers to extract the highest borrowing power out of their collateral;\n- Isolation Mode limits exposure and risks to the protocol from newly listed assets by only permitting borrowing up to a specific debt ceiling;\n- Risk Management Improvements provide additional protection for the protocol through various risk caps and other tools;\n- L2-Specific Features designs specific to Layer 2 networks to improve user experience and reliability;\n- Portal allows assets to seamlessly flow between Aave V3 markets over different networks;Community Contribution facilitates and incentivizes community usage through a modular, well-organized codebase.\n\nThese new features offer flexibility for Aave V3 users. In the last few months, new markets have been created based on community proposals thanks to the V3 supply caps and isolation mode, which add risk mitigation features so that the community can manage such markets on the Aave Protocol.\n\nOne of the most talked about features of V3, Portal, has already found a use case for bridges like Connext as detailed in [their proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-whitelist-connext-for-v3-portals/8047) to the Aave DAO, allowing for Connext’s LPs to access immediate extra liquidity to fulfil transactions in a trust minimized way. Other proposals have followed suit, such as [this one](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-whitelist-debridge-for-portals-v3/8259) from deBridge.\n\nV3 has also seen demand for stable Efficiency Mode (eMode), with proposals for new asset listings such as this one for FRAX continually taking advantage of Aave V3’s capital efficiency. So far, over 4,100 borrowing addresses have enabled eMode, accounting for 12% of all borrowing wallets on V3. Power users and automated strategies likely will utilize eMode more frequently as more liquidity enters market ecosystems. In light of recent significant crypto market events, risk management features such as isolation mode have also proven to be prescient.\n\nAave V3 markets attracted liquidity quickly, with the Avalanche V3 market growing to a market size of $2.22 billion, driven by the Avalanche Rush rewards despite adverse market conditions. Much of this growth was in stable assets, accounting for ~60% of total supply since mid-April. We have seen this growth in activity mirrored on V3 on Optimism, which in the recent weeks has risen to a market size of $2 billion. We expect this increase in liquidity and usage to be mirrored across other versions of Aave V3 moving forward.\n\nDuring May and June’s difficult crypto-ecosystem events, liquidations functioned well across V3 markets, minimizing insolvencies while market size was reduced by two thirds. V3 also provides the ability to set liquidation collection factors, meaning the DAO can benefit from fee accumulation during liquidation events. This is particularly pertinent given the extent of recent liquidation events in the industry.\n\nThese examples are only the tip of the iceberg, and we expect V3 to continue to further prove itself over time as users experiment with the new features and opportunities. The Aave Grants DAO has been playing, and will continue to play, a large role in this by helping to fund creative projects that take advantage of V3 and add value to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **What is the Compensation Model based on?**\n\nWe propose that the Aave DAO retribute $15 million (work incurred) and $1.28 million (audits) to the Aave Companies to retroactively fund the development of Aave V3, cover the cost of audits, incentivize further building on the Aave Protocol, and enable sustainable building within the Aave ecosystem. This request covers the work done by members of the Aave Companies over more than a year.\n\nOverall, there were multiple functions involved in V3’s creation. These functions included Data Science, Risk Management, QnA, Dev Ops, Smart Contract Engineering, Front-end Engineering, Back-end Engineering, Product, and Design. On top of the direct work done on V3 by the aforementioned departments there were a number of supporting measures that helped maintain high standards of security and quality throughout the process.\n\nBelow you can find a breakdown of the different teams that make up the Aave V3 Working Group at the Aave Companies:\n\n![aavepod](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aave/aip/Pending-AIPs/content/assets/a22882572b3f-AIP-V3-RETROACTIVE-FUNDING/aavepod.jpeg)\n\nIn terms of costs related to incurred work for V3, 60% are associated with engineering roles, whilst 40% are related to non-engineering roles.\n\nMore than full-time personnel costs, there were significant operational costs associated with the creation of V3, from equipment to software, which is included in our calculations for incurred work.\n\nThere were also two rounds of extensive and in-depth audits. The first round of audits was conducted by ABDK, OpenZeppelin, Trail of Bits, and Peckshield. The second round was done by SigmaPrime. Certora provided [formal verification](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/Certora/certora/Verification_Report.pdf). These were important expenses given the Aave community’s high standards regarding security and ethos. A more digestible breakdown of these security measures is shown in the table below:\n\n|  **Auditor**  |  **Date**  |                                                 **Report**                                                 | **Round** |\n| :-----------: | :--------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------: |\n|     ABDK      | 27-01-2022 |         [ABDK](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_ABDK_AaveV3.pdf)         |     1     |\n| OpenZeppelin  | 01-11-2021 | [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/01-11-2021_OpenZeppelin_AaveV3.pdf) |     1     |\n| Trail of Bits | 07-01-2022 | [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/07-01-2022_TrailOfBits_AaveV3.pdf) |     1     |\n|  Peckshield   | 14-01-2022 |   [Peckshield](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/14-01-2022_PeckShield_AaveV3.pdf)   |     1     |\n|  SigmaPrime   | 14-01-2022 |   [SigmaPrime](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_SigmaPrime_AaveV3.pdf)   |     2     |\n\n### <a name=\"compesation\">Compensation Model</a>\n\nIf the AIP is approved by the DAO, the Aave team will receive $16,280,000 million in retroactive funding for the development of Aave Protocol V3. The funding will consist of $5,456,993.61 between DAI, USDT and USDC; $1,148,881.31 in alternative stable assets, $3,394,125.08 million in more volatile crypto assets; and \\$6,280,000 million in AAVE tokens.\n\nThe \\$6.28 million in AAVE tokens requested will be based on a 14-day TWAP - time weighted average price (average of open, high, low, close) per Messari at UTC+0 - from the moment the proposal is approved in a Snapshot vote.\n\nThe funding of the aforementioned \\$6.28 million in AAVE tokens will be reimbursed with two lock-up periods. 50% of the AAVE tokens received will be deposited in the Safety Module for one year, whilst the other 50% of AAVE tokens will be deposited in the Safety Module for two years. During this time, the tokens will contribute to the protocol safety module, helping to reduce risk for the protocol. Based on this model, Aave Companies would be free to use the tokens after the end of each lock-up period.\n\nWe request that the USDC, DAI, and USDT be broken down as follows:\n\n|                              |    **USDC**    |    **DAI**     |    **USDT**    |\n| :--------------------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |\n| **Approximate % Breakdown**  |      51%       |      30%       |      19%       |\n| **Total \\$ Value Requested** | \\$2,783,066.74 | \\$1,637,098.08 | \\$1,036,828.78 |\n\nRegarding the \\$1,148,881.31 in alternative stable assets, a small volatility discount has been applied to each asset to account for peg fluctuations and low liquidity. These discounts are based on the lowest close price of each asset in the past 90 days. An itemized view of the requested alternative assets and their respective discounts can be found below:\n\n| **Token** | **Volatility Discount** | **Number** |   **Value**    |\n| :-------: | :---------------------: | :--------: | :------------: |\n| **sUSD**  |          -0.2%          | 463,358.33 |   462,526.88   |\n| **TUSD**  |          -0.4%          | 292,927.66 |   291,647.27   |\n| **FRAX**  |          -1.4%          | 154,992.10 |   152,830.21   |\n| **BUSD**  |          -0.5%          | 130,749.62 |   130,142.79   |\n| **GUSD**  |          -1.4%          | 86,354.30  |   85,154.05    |\n| **USDP**  |          -1.1%          | 26,871.32  |   26,580.10    |\n| **Total** |                         |            | \\$1,148,881.31 |\n\nFurther, the remaining \\$3,394,125.08 that will be composed of more volatile crypto assets will remain fixed. The price will be determined by TWAP - time weighted average price (average of open, high, low, close) per Messari at UTC+0 on the day the Snapshot vote is made.\n\nLooking at the volatility of ETH over the last week, there is daily implied volatility of 5%. This does not mean that every day ETH will move by 5%, but on average, the general size of the moves will be so big that their standard deviation will be 5%.\n\nAssuming a normal distribution of returns, there is a 68% chance prices move 5% daily, a 95% chance that prices move 10% and 99% chance they are 15%. When looking at the actual daily movements we see an average difference between the daily high and low prices of 6.6%, with a maximum difference of 13.2%. With the exception of BTC, most assets we are requesting have volatility equal to or exceeding ETH.\n\nGiven the time delay of at least 1-2 weeks between the end of the Snapshot and execution of the AIP, we are asking for a flat 10% discount on the market value of non-stable crypto assets to account for this extreme market volatility. This accounts for expected daily volatility of the assets and the time delay between asset pricing and any hedge execution we need to make.\n\nAny difference between the aforementioned $3,394,125.08 value and the TWAP value at the close of the Snapshot will be made up for with additional AAVE tokens which will not be subject to a lock if the price of the assets has reduced. If the volatile assets are worth more than $3,394,125.08 after the discount at the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, then the amount of USDC et al will be lowered proportionally. This is to ensure the amount of stable funding requested from the DAO remains fixed.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the requested assets with the 10% discount outlined can be found below:\n\n| **Token**  | **Volatility Discount** | **Tokens Requested** | **Current Price** | **Value w/ Discount** |\n| :--------: | :---------------------: | :------------------: | :---------------: | :-------------------: |\n| **WMATIC** |           10%           |      850,000.00      |       0.80        |      612,000.00       |\n| **WAVAX**  |           10%           |      29,000.00       |       22.60       |      589,860.00       |\n|  **CRV**   |           10%           |      509,732.68      |       1.10        |      504,635.36       |\n|  **WETH**  |           10%           |        350.00        |     1,597.00      |      503,055.00       |\n|  **WBTC**  |           10%           |        23.62         |     21,300.00     |      452,817.23       |\n|  **SNX**   |           10%           |      96,251.92       |       3.00        |      259,880.19       |\n|  **RAI**   |           10%           |      66,094.61       |       2.92        |      173,535.14       |\n|  **MANA**  |           10%           |      103,234.63      |       0.82        |       76,558.80       |\n|  **LINK**  |           10%           |      12,053.48       |       7.01        |       76,045.43       |\n|  **YFI**   |           10%           |         7.08         |     8,951.00      |       57,067.95       |\n|  **CVX**   |           10%           |       5,137.26       |       5.29        |       24,458.50       |\n|  **MKR**   |           10%           |        30.36         |      835.00       |       22,812.38       |\n|  **KNC**   |           10%           |      12,031.49       |       1.85        |       20,032.43       |\n|  **UNI**   |           10%           |       1,685.66       |       6.99        |       10,604.50       |\n|  **ENJ**   |           10%           |       7,242.48       |       0.55        |       3,585.03        |\n| **xSUSHI** |           10%           |       2,331.22       |       1.58        |       3,314.99        |\n|  **BAT**   |           10%           |       6,395.16       |       0.36        |       2,072.03        |\n|  **REN**   |           10%           |      15,300.17       |       0.13        |       1,790.12        |\n| **Total**  |                         |                      |                   |    \\$3,394,125.08     |\n\nThis compensation model aims to reduce the burden on the DAO’s stablecoin reserves by diversifying the requested compensation to include other assets from the DAO treasury.\n\nAs part of this retro funding proposal, we gave great consideration to the continued economic health of the DAO and the variety of tokens requested.\n\nWith these amendments, this ARC will go to Snapshot for vote by the DAO.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo conclude, this proposal outlines a request for the Aave DAO to provide feedback and validation for granting Aave Companies funding for the creation of Aave V3.\n\nAave V3 is a protocol that emphasizes capital efficiency, security, and risk management. It is a reflection of both the current and future success of the community.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal transfers the requested funds to the Aave Companies, following the compensation model described above. The requested assets are pulled from multiple contracts, fee collectors and ecosystem reserves across networks.\n\nThese are the main actions included in the proposal:\n\n1. Transfer of AAVE assets from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve.\n2. Transfer of aToken assets from the AaveCollector of Ethereum V2 Market.\n3. Upgrade the AaveCollector contract of Polygon V2 and V3 Markets to add the ability to retrieve funds from themselves.\n4. Transfer of aToken assets from the AaveCollector of Polygon V2 Market.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the assets to transfer, following the considerations described in the [Compensation](#compesation) section, can be found below:\n\n| **Received Token** |  **# Tokens**  | **Market Value USD (w/ Discount)** | **Transfer Method** |\n| :----------------: | :------------: |

It allows users to stake their MATIC tokens on the Ethereum mainnet and immediately get the representation of their share in the form of stMATIC token without maintaining staking infrastructure. Users will receive staking rewards whilst being able to utilize their stMATIC tokens in secondary pools on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon.\n\nListing stMATIC as collateral will enable depositors to borrow funds against stMATIC. In addition, a special 'MATIC correlated' eMode will be created for just stMATIC and wMATIC, a $7.5M Supply Cap will be set and borrowing disabled to manage the risk exposure with this asset listing.\n\n# Motivation\n\nListing stMATIC on the Aave v3 pool would allow Aave DAO to benefit from the first mover advantage and hopefully in time replicate the success of the stETH listing which has generated $1.38B in TVL on the Ethereum Aave v2 pool. \n\nAs with the stETH listing on Ethereum Aave v2 pool, we expect stMATIC to stimulate demand for wMATIC and other assets.

MaticX is an ERC20 receipt token which represents staked MATIC and a portion of the staking rewards.\n\n# Abstract\n\nStader is building a native staking smart contract platform spanning multiple networks that enables users to develop staking-related applications. The MaticX product selects validators based upon performance, safety, decentralisation and the commission terms to ensure users receive the best user experience in supporting the Polygon Network. \n\nMaticX allows users to stake their MATIC tokens on the Ethereum mainnet or Polygon and immediately get the representation of their share in the form of MaticX token without maintaining staking infrastructure. Users will receive staking rewards whilst being able to utilise their MaticX tokens in secondary markets on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon.\n\nMaticX will be added as collateral and Users will be able to borrow against their MaticX deposits. A SupplyCap of $6M will be implemented, borrowing disabled and Matrix will be added to the 'Matic correlated' eMode. \n\n# Motivation\n\nListing MaticX on the Aave v3 Polygon Pool will allow Aave DAO to benefit from the first mover advantage and provide an alternative to Lido’s stMATIC. \n\nIn addition to being able to stake on Ethereum mainnet, MaticX allows users to stake Matic directly on Polygon through a unique instant pool mechanism while remaining on Polygon throughout. This is expected to drive staking penetration higher for MATIC with Users being able to enjoy the cheaper, faster transactions on Polygon to stake.\n\nMaticX offers users a maximum 50 hours withdrawal period, which is shorter than alternatives and is expected to support a tighter secondary spot market price relative to the fundamental value of the receipt token’s claim.\n\nWith the introduction of eMode on Aave v3, there exists the potential for users to recursive loop MaticX and wMATIC to create a significant source of yield provided borrowing rates remain accommodative. \n\n## Specification\n\nIn supporting the MaticX asset listing, this proposal creates a liquidity pool that reflects the characteristics shown below and connect the Chainlink oracle price source to AaveOracle.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nAll the components involved in this proposal (tokens' implementations, interest rate strategy, oracle feed, proposal payload) have been tested and reviewed, including simulations on mainnet of the whole proposal lifecycle.\n\nThis proposal has been tested and peer reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://twitter.com/bgdlabs).\n\nLink to Test Cases: [Here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-v3-crosschain-maticx-listing/blob/master/src/test/PolygonMaticXE2E.t.sol)\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis proposal presents the following parameter configuration upon listing MaticX.\n\nRisk Parameters:\n\nCollateral: Yes\nBorrowing: No\nLTV: 50%\nLiquidation Threshold: 65%\nLiquidation Bonus: 10%\nReserve Factor: 20%\nChainlink Oracle: [0x5d37E4b374E6907de8Fc7fb33EE3b0af403C7403](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5d37E4b374E6907de8Fc7fb33EE3b0af403C7403)\n\nVariable Interest Rate Parameters:\n\nUOptimal: 45%\nR_0: 0%\nR_s1: 7%\nR_s2: 300%\n\n'MATIC correlated' eMode Parameters:\n\nLTV: 92.5%\nLiquidation Threshold: 95%\nLiquidation Bonus: 1%\n \nSupply / Borrow Caps:\n\nNewSupplyCap: $6m MaticX\n\nThe governance forum proposal discussing Add MaticX on Aave v3 Polygon pool can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/7995) and the snapshot vote can be found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x88e896a245ffeda703e0b8f5494f3e66628be6e32a7243e3341b545c2972857f). \n\nLink to Payload Implementation: [Here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-v3-crosschain-maticx-listing/blob/master/src/contracts/polygon/MaticXPayload.sol)\n\n**Deployed Contracts**\nProposalPayload = [0xD417d07c20e31F6e129fa68182054B641FbEC8Bd](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xD417d07c20e31F6e129fa68182054B641FbEC8Bd)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust seven (7) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Loan To Value, across four (4) Aave V2 assets. \n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds.\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n**Top 30 borrowers' aggregate positions & borrow usages**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M7RmBhu.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers' entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sSePhV4.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers' entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VvMhK26.png)\n\n\n**Top USDC non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qYutxwQ.png)\n\n**Top WETH non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qbdHyQv.png)\n\n**Top AAVE non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tu0XhpN.png)\n\n**Top UNI non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nHis6TW.png)\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jiBbDA0.png)\n\nAs shown in the below chart and dashboard screenshot, our simulations show that Aave can increase capital efficiency while also decreasing the risk of bad debt.\n\nThese liquidation threshold increases, assuming unit elasticity, result in a projected increase of $8.22M in total borrows across assets. The following chart breaks down the top projected borrow increases by symbol:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jVqTfXL.png)\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n\n\n### Aave V2 Dashboard\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YFSkvU3.png)\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonus, LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-and-aave-arc-fireblocks-2022-09-22/9983).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n",

This proposal details how Aave DAO will enable anyone with an EOA to convert the DAO’s aFEI holding to an aDAI holding. \n\nBased upon available FEI liquidity in the FEI Reserve, Aave DAO’s aFEI will be redeemed for FEI, swapped for DAI, and then deposited into the DAI Reserve on Ethereum.

Any user seeking to claim 80,069.50 units or less is able to do so now, but this may change as others start redeeming aFEI. \n\nMigrating Aave’s aFEI holding in the Reserve Factor to aDAI can not be performed in a single transaction and therefore must occur gradually over time as FEI liquidity becomes available.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below provides a broad, high level summary of how any EOA calling the `swapAllAvailable` function from the Swapper contract will convert aFEI to aDAI. \n\nThe contract determines the maximum amount of aFEI to be redeemed by assessing the amount of aFEI held in the Reserve Factor and the amount FEI in the FEI Reserve. The lower of the two amounts will be used to redeem aFEI to FEI.\n\nAll FEI held within the Reserve Factor will then be swapped for DAI via Tribe DAO’s SimpleFeiDaiPSM. There are no fees, the exchange rate is fixed at 1:1 (Example: unwrapping wETH to ETH), and there is around $57.4 Million of liquidity at the time of writing, [1]. \n\nDAI is then deposited into the DAI Reserve and the Ethereum Reserve Factor will receive aDAI.\n\n# Test Cases\n\nThis proposal has been tested and peer reviewed by Bored Ghost Developing, [5].\n\nTest cases, payload, and Swapper can be found at reference [6], [7] & [8] respectively.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe governance payload is deployed at [9], the Swapper contract is deployed at [10].\n\nThe payload gives the Swapper aFEI max allowance from the Aave Ethereum Reserve Factor and calls the `swapAllAvailable` function on the Swapper.\n\nWhen called, Swapper transfers all possible aFEI from the Aave Ethereum Reserve Factor ([0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c)) to the payload contract via the Aave Ecosystem Controller ([0x3d569673dAa0575c936c7c67c4E6AedA69CC630C](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d569673dAa0575c936c7c67c4E6AedA69CC630C)) transfer function.\n\nThe proposal redeems aFEI for FEI via the FEI Reserve ([0x7d2768dE32b0b80b7a3454c06BdAc94A69DDc7A9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7d2768dE32b0b80b7a3454c06BdAc94A69DDc7A9)).\n\nThe proposal redeems all available FEI for DAI via the Tribe DAO Fixed Price PSM ([0x2A188F9EB761F70ECEa083bA6c2A40145078dfc2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2A188F9EB761F70ECEa083bA6c2A40145078dfc2)), depositing all DAI in the Aave V2 Ethereum DAI Reserve with the Aave Ethereum Reserve Factor ([0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c](0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c)) as the beneficiary.\n\n# References\n\n1.

      "description": "\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nLlama outlines a 12-month proposal to work with Aave on treasury management, protocol upgrades, growth, and analytics.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal acts as a mandate from the Aave community to engage with Llama for the work defined on the Aave governance forum [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-llama-aave/9924) and pre-approved by the Aave community via Snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x9f65a598bee69a1dd84127d712ffedbc0795f0647e89056a297cae998dd18bf1).\n\n# Motivation\n\n[Llama](https://www.llama.xyz/) is one of the most active contributors to Aave. We hope to deepen our engagement with the community and ensure that Aave is a market-leading protocol for many decades to come.\n\nAave currently has $9 billion of liquidity locked across 7 networks and over 13 pools, with more in the works. To continue its rate of growth, the community needs to onboard proven contributors who can drive value to the Aave ecosystem. Skilled teams have the knowledge, trust, and alignment to meaningfully contribute to growing Aave.\n\nLlama has received grants from Aave Grants DAO over the past 12 months for work that includes treasury management, protocol upgrades, DAO to DAO partnerships, and analytics. Aave Grants has recommended that we move from short-term grants to a longer-term work scope funded through governance, allowing us to drive more impact to the Aave ecosystem. It should be noted that many of the deliverables in this proposal require substantial smart contract engineering, data engineering, and financial expertise.\n\nLlama charges a $1.5 million base fee plus a bonus of upto $500k based on completion of deliverables. 70% of the total fee will be in aUSDC and 30% in AAVE. Note that the bonus payment is not included in this proposal but will be included in a separate proposal towards the end of our 12-month period.\n\nWe will provide regular updates on the forum with details of our work and will solicit feedback from the community to ensure we continue to uphold the commitments outlined in our forum post. Towards the end of the 12-month period, a renewal proposal will be shared with Aave governance.\n\n## Specification\n\nA full specification of the payload contract and tests enabling this mandate can be found on the Llama Github [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-llama-proposal).\n\nIn summary, the proposal:\n1. Transfers upfront 350,000 aUSDC ($0.35 Million) to the Llama-controlled address.\n2. Transfers upfront 1,813.68 AAVE ($0.15 Million using 30 day TWAP on day of proposal) to the Llama-controlled address.\n3. Creates a 12-month stream of 700,000 aUSDC ($0.7 Million) to the Llama-controlled address.\n4. Creates a 12-month stream of 3,627.35 AAVE ($0.3 Million using 30 day TWAP on day of proposal) to the Llama-controlled address.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThe Proposal Payload has been tested and peer reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://twitter.com/bgdlabs), including simulations on mainnet of the whole proposal lifecycle.\n\nLink to Test Cases: [Here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-llama-proposal/blob/main/src/test/ProposalPayload.t.sol)\n\n## Implementation\n\nLink to Payload Implementation: [Here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-llama-proposal/blob/main/src/ProposalPayload.sol)\n\n**Deployed Contracts**\nProposalPayload = [0xbDd286d4b9BfbD10319f3FCd1c76e9ECA12a80Ee](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbdd286d4b9bfbd10319f3fcd1c76e9eca12a80ee)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold, Loan To Value, and Liquidation Bonus, across two (2) Aave V2 assets. \n\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ aggregate positions & borrow usages**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Shar1i3.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DcrG6hE.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/60LomXa.png)\n\n\n\n**Top STETH non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/o2zzUVf.png)\n\n**Top WBTC non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JL3W7IP.png)\n\n\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hKVasEl.png)\n\n\n\n\nWe have ingested the most recent Aave and market data, including user positions, prices, volatility, and liquidity for all assets, including stETH, WETH, and WBTC. We then ran simulations to stress test the protocol in times of high volatility.\n\nAs shown in the dashboard screenshot below, our simulations show that Aave can increase capital efficiency while decreasing the risk of bad debt using these parameterization recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n\n\n### Aave V2 Dashboard\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CGcOHWG.png)\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonus, LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-and-aave-arc-fireblocks-2022-10-06/10201).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n",

      "description": "\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal updates FEI’s Reserve Factor on Aave v2 Ethereum from 100% to 99%. As noted by [BGD](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v2-ethereum-fei-security-report/10251), the current configuration of FEI’s Reserve Factor at 100% does not accrue variable borrow debt and does not redirect the Reserve Factor fees to the Collector smart contract.\n\n# Abstract\n\nAs noted [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v2-ethereum-fei-security-report/10251), the Reserve Factor (RF) on Aave is a percentage representing the proportion of the supplier’s yield that gets redirected to the protocol as a “fee”.\n\nOn every user action, when the new interest rate is calculated, the amount of aTokens calculated from the RF of that specific asset gets minted to the Collector. In addition, extra accounting gets done on the so-called “indexes” of the asset (supply/variable borrow), which represent the total accumulation of yield on both supply and borrow side.\n\nIt is important to highlight that the reserve factor gets discounted when calculating the supply rate, prior to further accounting like the indexes.\n\nOn September 05, [Aave governance proposal 96](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/96/) was executed, freezing the FEI asset on Aave v2 Ethereum.\n\nInitially, the payload seemed fine and performed two actions:\n1. Call a freeze() function on the protocol for FEI.\n2. In order for suppliers of FEI to not have incentives and withdraw, “redirect” all yield on the borrowers’ side to the protocol’s Collector. This was done by setting the Reserve Factor configuration of FEI to 100% (maximum).\n\nLater, it was realized that the variable borrow interest did not properly accrue for FEI borrowers. After some debugging, it was realized that the issue was caused by a side effect of configuring any RF to exactly 100%.\n\nThe temporary solution to fix this (until the protocol is updated to handle reserve factor of 100% correctly), is to set the FEI reserve factor to 99% through this AIP.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe full motivation for this AIP can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v2-ethereum-fei-security-report/10251)\n\n# Specification\n\nA full specification of the payload contract and tests enabling this mandate can be found on the Llama Github [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-fei-rf-update)\n\nThe Proposal Payload does the following:\n1. Sets FEI Reserve Factor from 100% to 99%.\n2. If liquidity is available to withdraw, then calls `swapAllAvailable()` on the [aFEI to aDAI Swapper Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9A953AC1090C7014D00FD205D89c6BA1C219Af8b)\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThis proposal has been tested and peer reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://twitter.com/bgdlabs).\n\nTest cases can be found: [Here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-fei-rf-update/blob/main/src/test/ProposalPayloadE2E.t.sol)\n\n## Implementation\n\nPayload Implementation can be found: [Here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-fei-rf-update/blob/main/src/ProposalPayload.sol)\n\n## Deployed Contracts\n\nProposal Payload = [0x993ee4acc9F736fd3e47846d18b397d06B899112](https://etherscan.io/address/0x993ee4acc9f736fd3e47846d18b397d06b899112)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal outlines a 12-month engagement for Chaos Labs to build and utilize risk and simulation tooling to help optimizations and protect Aave v3 markets.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal acts as a mandate from the Aave community to engage with Chaos for the work defined on the Aave governance forum [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025) and pre-approved by the Aave community via Snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xad105e87d4df487bbe1daec2cd94ca49d1ea595901f5773c1804107539288b59).\n\n## Motivation\n\nChaos Labs is eager to collaborate with Aave to ensure it maintains its position as a best-in-class DeFi protocol with one of the most serious and intentional risk operations. Aave v3 has over $1b in locked TVL and will shortly be launching on Ethereum, drastically increasing the assets controlled and the users engaging with it. Chaos has previously built a [v3 Risk Dashboard](http://aave.chaoslabs.xyz/ccar) to help monitor these positions and is excited to expand that capability using its proprietary on-chain simulation engine.\n\nChaos Labs will focus on risk management and parameter recommendations for all v3 markets.\n\nThis includes:\n\n- Borrow & lending caps recommendations\n- Collateral factors recommendations\n- Interest rates recommendations\n- Asset listing risk analytics & tooling\n- Open-sourced agent access\n- Extending the AAVE v3 Risk Analytics App\n- Community Risk Calls\n\nWhile incorporating feedback from the community, we have committed to building trust between the Aave community and Chaos Labs. To this end, the payment streams will not start until 6 months after AIP approval with two incentive-based payments not included in this proposal but will be submitted after delivery. The DAO may terminate our engagement after 6 months prior to this stream initializing.\n\n## Specification\n\nA full specification of the payload contract and tests enabling this mandate can be found on the Chaos Labs Github [here](https://github.com/ChaosLabsInc/aave-chaos-v3-risk-proposal).\n\nIn summary, the proposal creates a 6-month stream of 500,000 aUSDC ($0.5 Million) to the Chaos-controlled address starting at block height equivalent to the 6-month anniversary of on-chain approval.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThe Proposal Payload has been tested and peer-reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://twitter.com/bgdlabs), including simulations on mainnet of the whole proposal lifecycle.\n\nLink to Test Cases: [Here](https://github.com/ChaosLabsInc/aave-chaos-v3-risk-proposal/tree/main/src/test)\n\n## Implementation\n\nLink to Payload Implementation: [Here](https://github.com/ChaosLabsInc/aave-chaos-v3-risk-proposal/blob/main/src/ProposalPayload.sol)\n\n**Deployed Contracts** ProposalPayload = 0x691B41805f7Ef2D7De6165bC42295b035a31600D\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nIn the last six months, Certora has improved the security of the Aave protocol and played a significant role in increasing the security community’s involvement in Aave’s development. We want to continue to improve Aave’s security and enable agile development of new products. This proposal will give a brief overview of Certora and formal verification, outline what we’ve accomplished in the last six months, and discuss our goals for ensuring Aave’s security.\n\n## Abstract\n\nCertora is a security company focused on delivering tools that enable developers to mathematically prove the correctness of DeFi protocols. In the last six months, Certora worked closely with the Aave community, Aave developers, BGD labs, and external communities, including The Secureum 1, to guarantee the security of the Aave protocol and enable massive innovation.\n\nWe engaged twenty external security researchers who, along with our team of security engineers and researchers, helped Aave safely develop 16 new products and list 12 new tokens. A total of 51 smart contracts were reviewed which contained over 25,000 lines of Solidity code. One critical and two high-severity bugs were prevented using the hundreds of correctness rules written by the community and the Certora team.\n\nAs we continue our collaboration, we plan to improve on the current proposal in five significant ways: \n1. Allocate more resources\n2. Improve the Certora Prover\n3. Develop new open source technology for automatically checking rules written by the community \n4. Drastically improve the collaboration with auditors and the security research community, and \n5. Develop a monitoring framework for checking the CVL rules before every transaction.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe propose to continue the current engagement. Below are the highlights of what we will accomplish:\n\n- Allocate six R&D personnel to lead the community in specification development for the Aave protocol.\n- Write specifications and verify new Aave products and listed tokens.\n- Provide free access to our SaaS tooling (Certora Prover) to members of the Aave community.\n- Develop and improve our technology to address needs raised by the Aave verification efforts. We will continue to provide new tools to the Aave community as they are developed.\n- Develop our education materials and be available to the community to help them learn to use our tools.\n- Continue to grow Aave’s security community and incentivize the best of this community to engage with Aave more closely. We propose to award several fellowships to the best security researchers to work closely with Aave and Certora. We have identified leading candidates who contributed to this year’s program.\n- Certora will collaborate with Sigma Prime to help them use the Certora Prover as part of their - ongoing security review 1. We will also collaborate with other third parties such as Secureum, who are working to ensure the security of Aave and building the Aave community. Additionally, Code4rena and Spearbit security researchers are proficient in rule writing. For example, Kurt Barry, who works as an independent security researcher through Spearbit, was able to find a 4 year old bug in the MakeDao tool using the Certora Prover. Therefore, for major code revisions, we will conduct Code4rena competitions for finding bugs and writing correctness rules\n\n## Specification\n\nA full specification of the payload contract and tests enabling this mandate can be found on the Certora's Github [here](https://github.com/Certora/aave-certora-nov22-proposal)\n\nThe Proposal Payload does the following:\n1. Creates a 12-month stream of 1,890,000 aUSDC ($1.89M) to the Certora beneficiary address.\n2. Creates a 12-month stream of 9958 AAVE ($810,000) to the Certora beneficiary address.\nWe've used the 30 days average AAVE price, to calculate the amount of AAVE tokens that corresponds to the $810,000 sum in the proposal. The json file with the price data used is available \n[here](https://github.com/Certora/aave-certora-nov22-proposal/blob/main/data/aave-30d-price-coingecko.json)\n\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThe Proposal Payload has been tested and peer-reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://twitter.com/bgdlabs), including simulations on mainnet of the whole proposal lifecycle.\n\nLink to Test Cases: [Here](https://github.com/Certora/aave-certora-nov22-proposal/tree/main/src/test)\n\n## Implementation\n\nLink to Payload Implementation: [Here](https://github.com/Certora/aave-certora-nov22-proposal/blob/main/src/ProposalPayload.sol)\n\n**Deployed Contracts** ProposalPayload = 0x2D2b1Bf70d98ae9A8CC9A3d7a49C2d321eCC6C04\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The discussion can be found on the [Aave governance forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-deploy-bal-to-vebal/9747).\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe 100,000 BAL acquisition further extends the DAO's holding to be used for supporting the growth of the Aave ecosystem. There are numerous opportunities within the Aave ecosystem to utilise veBAL. The BAL emissions are expected to lead to higher TVL and attract new users/use cases to Aave which will lead to additional revenue generation or alternatively reduce the AAVE emissions via the Safety Module. Exactly how the veBAL is to be utilised by the DAO is still open for discussion. \n\nFurther insights into the motivation behind this proposal can be found below:\n1. [ARC : Strategic Partnership with Balancer Part #2](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer-part-2/7813)\n2.

[ARC : ERC4626 Strategies as Productive Collateral](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-erc4626-strategies-as-productive-collateral/10337)\n\n# Specification\n\nA full specification of the payload contract, bonding curve contract and tests enabling this mandate can be found on the Llama Github [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-bal-bonding-curve).\n\nLlama will deploy a bonding curve enabling aUSDC held within the [Aave V2 Collector](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) to be exchanged for BAL, with the traders receiving a 50 bps reward over the [BAL/USD Chainlink oracle](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdF2917806E30300537aEB49A7663062F4d1F2b5F) price for performing the transaction. The amount of BAL to be acquired is fixed and set at 100,000 BAL. The maximum amount of aUSDC that will be approved for spending from the Aave V2 Collector by the bonding curve and used in acquiring the BAL will be set at 800,000 aUSDC.\n\nThe aUSDC does not leave the Aave V2 Collector as the Bonding Curve enables the aUSDC to be transferred from the Collector to the trader's wallet upon the Collector receiving BAL from the trader.\n\nThe Proposal Payload does the following:\n1. Approve the Bonding Curve contract to spend 800,000 aUSDC from the Aave V2 Collector.\n\nThe Bonding Curve contract has the following functions and public storage variables:\n1. `function purchase(uint256 amountIn, bool toUnderlying) external returns (uint256)`: This function allows the trader to purchase aUSDC/USDC for BAL, with the trader receiving a 50 bps reward over the BAL/USD Chainlink oracle price. It takes `uint256 amountIn` (BAL amount input including 18 decimals) and `bool toUnderlying` (Whether to receive as USDC (true) or aUSDC (false)) as input parameters and returns the amount of aUSDC/USDC (including 6 decimals) received on purchase. \n2. `function availableBalToBeFilled() public view returns (uint256)`: This getter/view function returns how close to the 100k BAL amount cap the bonding curve contract is at. Trader check this function before calling `purchase()` to see the amount of BAL left to be filled in the bonding curve contract. This should give the trader information on upto how much BAL they can put in the `amountIn` input parameter of the `purchase()` function.\n3. `function getAmountOut(uint256 amountIn) public view returns (uint256)` : This getter/view function returns the amount of aUSDC/USDC that will be received after a bonding curve purchase using given BAL amount input (including the 50 bps reward over the BAL/USD Chainlink oracle price). Trader check this function before calling `purchase()` to see the amount of aUSDC/USDC you'll get for given BAL amount input.\n4. `function getOraclePrice() public view returns (uint256)` : This getter/view function returns the current peg price of the referenced Chainlink BAL/USD oracle as USD per BAL (value includes 8 decimals). \n5. `function rescueTokens(address[] calldata tokens) external` : This is a rescue function that can be called by anyone to transfer any tokens accidentally sent to the bonding curve contract to Aave V2 Collector. It takes an input list of token contract addresses. \n6. `uint256 public totalAusdcPurchased` : Cumulative aUSDC/USDC purchased through the bonding curve contract.\n7. `uint256 public totalBalReceived`: Cumulative BAL received through the bonding curve contract.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThis proposal has been tested and peer reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://twitter.com/bgdlabs).\n\nTest cases can be found: [Here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-bal-bonding-curve/blob/main/src/test/OneWayBondingCurveE2E.t.sol)\n\n## Implementation\n\n1.

The OP token is a governance token for the Optimism Collective.\nOP holders are currently able to vote on various decisions impacting the Collective, including the grants, protocol upgrades, inflation adjustments, and other fundamental changes.\nThe Collective is committed to an iterative governance system that will evolve dynamically over time.\nOptimism hopes to use the launch of this token to establish a deeper partnership between the Optimism and Aave communities.\nThis proposal would enable OP as collateral on AAVE V3 on Optimism.\n\n**Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nWith the recent release of the OP token, we want to bolster initial growth for Aave V3 on Optimism. This will benefit the Aave community by creating a vibrant ecosystem around Aave V3, while being a strong first use case for OP.\n\nAave would be one of the first platforms to support OP as collateral. The OP token is one of the first and leading rollup technology ecosystem tokens, so the Aave community would be supporting the scaling of Ethereum and onboard the cohort of users coming with it.\nL2s being the home for AAVE v3 could also gain a lot from this synergy.\n\nOverall, the use cases will create the opportunity to continue growing liquidity and usage of the Aave v3 pools on Optimism.\n\n**Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nInitially launched at the end of 2021, Optimism is an EVM equivalent L2 scaling solution. Optimism currently supports 100+ dapps and over $500m in on-chain value.\nOptimism drastically improves Ethereum’s scalability while retaining its security through rollup technology - having already saved its users over $1B in gas fees.\n\n**How is the asset currently used?**\n\nIt is used for governance on Optimism.\n\n**Emission schedule**\n\nAt genesis there was an initial total supply of 4,294,967,296 OP tokens. The total token supply is set to inflate at a rate of 2% per year, unless changed through governance.\n\n**Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.**\n\n**Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nThere is a multisig. It coontrols all funds in the chain. Members are anonymous in order to make the multisig more difficult to compromise.\n\n## Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n- Market Cap: ~$202M\n- 24h Volume: >$150M\n- Volatility: Low\n- Exchanges: Uniswap, Velodrome, Sushi\n- Maturity: Launched 5/31/21\n- Communities:\n- Discord - https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/\n- Twitter - https://twitter.com/OptimismFND\n- Mirror - https://optimism.mirror.xyz/\n- Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/optimismpbc\n\n- Date of deployment: May 31, 2021\n- Number of transactions: 12M\n- Number of holders: ~134k\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nOP has undergone audits.

The community can elect to Disable Borrowing whilst retaining the ability to Deposits assets across the majority of Reserves rather than Freezing as outlined in AIP-121.\n\nThis proposal is a collaborative effort between Llama and Chaos Labs and reflects the communities [governance forum discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-recommendations-for-aave-v2-eth-2022-11-22/10757/35). \n\n# Motivation\n\nIn response to recent market events and the continued contraction of liquidity across markets, this proposal seeks to reduce the risk profile across many higher volatile assets. AIP-121 presents an opportunity to Freeze many Reserves, whereas this proposal intends to Disable Borrowing whilst retaining the ability to deposit assets. \n\nAIP-121 is a more conservative response relative to this proposal. It is likely, LTV and LT thresholds for highly liqudity assets will also require amending in the near future.

      "description": "\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis governance proposal deploys and activates the different smart contract components result of the community project to create a bridge of Aave v2 Ethereum aTokens from/to StarkNet.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nAll the information regarding the project is explained on [https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-starknet-phase-i-release/10428](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-starknet-phase-i-release/10428). \n\nIn summary, with the previous approval of the project via governance, the Aave community has decided to start its expansion to StarkNet, a validity rollup, starting with smart contracts for bridging infrastructure of Aave v2 Ethereum aTokens.\n\nAdditionally, this also sets the foundation for the connection of instances of Aave in other networks (e.g. Polygon, Avalanche) with StarkNet.\n\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal's payload does the following:\n\n**Ethereum side**\n\n1. Deploys the `Bridge` smart contract, main component on Ethereum of the system, by calling a transparent proxy factory.\n2. Initializes the Ethereum `Bridge` to accept bridging of aUSDC, aUSDT and aDAI, with a 30'000 total ceiling for each one of them (in units of each asset, which in this case is relatively equivalent to USD).\n3. Sends a message via the StarkNet core messaging smart contract to activate the smart contract components on the StarkNet side.\n\n**StarkNet side**\n\n1. The message is received by the Governance Relay contract (proxy [HERE](https://starkscan.co/contract/0x07bbb769e53d886f77792d59b9cd65a2eb14a84c49a0942ba9577e291deefcec#class) and implementation [HERE](https://starkscan.co/class/0x0431f8e4ac4298966bdf1d99ea273d9f22e72005874d76498bd630fcb806f605#code)), which executes the payload on [https://starkscan.co/class/0x00be3e7fe64939ef463bc80b76703b93c10a61944de34df5bb2dbc7b734e3159#code](https://starkscan.co/class/0x00be3e7fe64939ef463bc80b76703b93c10a61944de34df5bb2dbc7b734e3159#code) via delegatecall.\n2. The payload connects and activates all the components: activates rewAAVE (representing AAVE rewards on StarkNet), connects the L1 Bridge to the L2 side of it, and connects the L1 aTokens to their static versions on L2.\n\nThe payload smart contract for Ethereum can be found [HERE](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4919E176f02142C20727da215e8dc1b3d046D026#code), \n\nThe payload smart contract for StarkNet can be found [HERE](https://starkscan.co/class/0x00be3e7fe64939ef463bc80b76703b93c10a61944de34df5bb2dbc7b734e3159#code).\n\nAll the other components are also present in the [same repository](https://github.com/aave-starknet-project/aave-starknet-bridge#deployed-contracts).\n\nAfter this proposal gets approved and executed, the `Bridge` will be fully operative on [https://etherscan.io/address/0x25c0667E46a704AfCF5305B0A586CC24c171E94D](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25c0667E46a704AfCF5305B0A586CC24c171E94D) (no code at the moment, being a counterfactual/CREATE2 deployment).\n\n## Security procedures\n\nThis proposal has been tested using the available tools to be as close as possible to fork both Ethereum and StarkNet mainnets.\n\nIn addition, all the components apart from the payload had gone through the security procedures enumerated on the Aave governance forum [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-starknet-phase-i-release/10428#security-procedures-5).\n\n[Bored Ghost Developing](https://twitter.com/bgdlabs) has reviewed the proposal payload too.\n\n\n## Deployed Contracts\n\n[https://github.com/aave-starknet-project/aave-starknet-bridge#deployed-contracts](https://github.com/aave-starknet-project/aave-starknet-bridge#deployed-contracts)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal will perform the next step in sunsetting Aave v1 by freezing all reserves on the `Aave Ethereum v1` and `Aave Ethereum Amm V1` pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave V1 was deployed on the Ethereum network back in January 2020, being the first step of everything that would come afterward on the Aave ecosystem. Since then, countless developments happened in the community, amongst them, 2 more iterations of the protocol: Aave v2 and Aave v3.\nAfter the deployment of Aave v2 Ethereum, almost 2 years ago (December 2020), the general approach of the community was to progressively sunset Aave v1, with steps like enabling a migration tool v1 → v2 and disabling stable borrowing on v1 (more information [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-protocol-v1-v2-migration-tool-and-transition-plan/2053)).\nTherefore the next step that was decided upon in this [snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xe4d1c311dcd4a4e392e0333494d3aac8a2521071097e85eeedc34994fa6ed72e) is to freeze all the `v1` reserves.\nWith this change in place, users can still repay & withdraw, but no longer supply and borrow.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal fetches the `LendingPoolCore` and `LendingPoolConfigurator` from the respective [Aave ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x24a42fD28C976A61Df5D00D0599C34c4f90748c8) and [Aave ethereum amm](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7fd53085B9A29D236235D6FC593b47C9C33429F1) LendingPoolAddressesProviders via `getLendingPoolCore()` & `getLendingPoolConfigurator()`.\nAs the next step it fetches all `reserves` via `lendingPoolCore.getReserves()` and freezes them one by one, by iterating though the list and calling `lendingPoolConfigurator.freezeReserve(reserve)`.\n\n## References\n\n- [Deployed implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6f02253c80a041a773efa35c98d4bc14a0f6ef9e#code)\n- [E2E test suite](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposal-freeze-v1/blob/master/tests/ProposalPayloadAaveFreezeV1.t.sol)\n- [ProposalPayloadAaveFreezeV1](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposal-freeze-v1/blob/master/src/contracts/ProposalPayloadAaveFreezeV1.sol)\n- [Original discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategy-on-sunsetting-of-aave-v1/9450)\n- [Related discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-dao-policy-change-halt-listings-on-all-aave-v1-v2-non-permissioned-deployments/10831/6)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nLlama recommends amending the ETH interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2 and v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWith Aave v3 about to be deployed and a wstETH and ETH eMode likely, the ETH Interest Rate Curve should be adjusted such that the looped recursive strategy breaks even within Slope 1, where the Interest Rate changes are less volatile.\n\nThe new interest rate curve has an Interest Rate of 5.75% at the Uoptimal point, which is 25 bps more than stETH yield at the time of writing. This proposal will lead to improved capital efficiency of the ETH Reserve and will generate more revenue for the DAO when compared to replicating the existing v2 Interest Rate curve on v3 with the introduction of an ETH eMode Category.\n\nFor the existing v2 market, Llama suggests adopting the same Interest Rate parameters that are being being proposed on v3. This will enable the ETH yields across the markets to somewhat equalize, leading to higher utilization of the ETH Reserve and more revenue for the DAO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nBy changing the Interest Rate at the Uopotimal point from 3% to 5.75%, when an eMode for ETH and wstETH is created on Aave v3, the recursive strategy will break even prior to reaching the Uoptimal utilization within the Reserve. This is a desirable feature as the volatility of the Interest Rate on Slope 1 is less than Slope 2.\n\n\nBy setting the Slope 1 parameter at 5.75% (25 bps greater than the current annual wstETH yield), utilization in the Reserve is not expected to reach the Uoptimal level for any prolonged period of time.\n\nBy reducing the Slope 2 parameter from 100 to 80, the gradient of the second part of the yield curve increases due to an increase in Uoptimal from 70% to 80%. This is subtle and can be seen in the chart below. The Base Rate for the existing Interest Rate and proposed Interest Rate is unchanged at 0%.\n\nWith the recommended new Interest Rate curve for the v3 deployment, it is reasonable to expect the yield across the v2 and v3 deployment to be arbitraged. If the yield on the v3 deployment converges to the wstETH rate, then this will shift the v2 Reserve utilization beyond the Uoptimal level set at 3%. \n\nLlama recommendeds changing the v2 Interest Rate to match the v3 deployment Interest Rate. This way, both v2 and v3 Reserves will experience utilization along the Slope 1 portion of the Interest Rate curve whilst also benefiting from improved capital efficiency.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uTjXDPz.png)\n\nThis proposal increases the Reserve Factor from 10% to 15%, directing 15% of the interest paid to Aave DAO. When combined with the Interest Rate changes, the v2 deployment will generate an estimated $13.1k per day, up from around $5.5k per day. \n\nPrior to this proposal, due the implementation of AIP-68, Aave DAO is earning less revenue from the ETH Reserve post-merge despite utilization within the Reserve [increasing](https://governance.aave.com/t/optimize-rate-curve-for-eth-improve-revenue-generation/7571) significantly over that time.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the ETH Reserve on Ethereum v2 and Ethereum v3 when deployed.\n\n| Parameter      | Current Variable (%) | Proposed Variable (%) | Current Stable (%) | Proposed Stable (%)   |\n| -------------- | ----------- | ------------ | -- | -- |\n| Uoptimal       | 70          | 80           | 70 | 80 |\n| Base           | 0           | 0            | 3.0| 3.0|\n| Slope1         | 3.0         | 5.75         | 4.0| 4.0|\n| Slope2         | 100         | 80           |100 | 80 |\n| Reserve Factor | 10          | 15           | 10 | 15 |\n\n# Implementation\n\nTest cases can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-interest-rate-update/blob/main/src/test/ProposalPayloadE2E.t.sol)\n\nPayload Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-interest-rate-update/blob/main/src/ProposalPayload.sol)\n\nProposal Payload = [0x98bc9dfa3cecb37f1bdeadc6e774d39082756b19](https://etherscan.io/address/0x98bc9dfa3cecb37f1bdeadc6e774d39082756b19#code)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal will perform the next step in sunsetting Aave v1 by freezing all reserves on the `Aave Ethereum v1` and `Aave Ethereum Amm V1` pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave V1 was deployed on the Ethereum network back in January 2020, being the first step of everything that would come afterward on the Aave ecosystem. Since then, countless developments happened in the community, amongst them, 2 more iterations of the protocol: Aave v2 and Aave v3.\nAfter the deployment of Aave v2 Ethereum, almost 2 years ago (December 2020), the general approach of the community was to progressively sunset Aave v1, with steps like enabling a migration tool v1 → v2 and disabling stable borrowing on v1 (more information [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-protocol-v1-v2-migration-tool-and-transition-plan/2053)).\nTherefore the next step that was decided upon in this [snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xe4d1c311dcd4a4e392e0333494d3aac8a2521071097e85eeedc34994fa6ed72e) is to freeze all the `v1` reserves.\nWith this change in place, users can still repay & withdraw, but no longer supply and borrow.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal fetches the `LendingPoolCore` and `LendingPoolConfigurator` from the respective [Aave ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x24a42fD28C976A61Df5D00D0599C34c4f90748c8) and [Aave ethereum amm](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7fd53085B9A29D236235D6FC593b47C9C33429F1) LendingPoolAddressesProviders via `getLendingPoolCore()` & `getLendingPoolConfigurator()`.\nAs the next step it fetches all `reserves` via `lendingPoolCore.getReserves()` and freezes them one by one, by iterating though the list and calling `lendingPoolConfigurator.freezeReserve(reserve)`.\n\n## References\n\n- [Deployed implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6f02253c80a041a773efa35c98d4bc14a0f6ef9e#code)\n- [E2E test suite](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposal-freeze-v1/blob/master/tests/ProposalPayloadAaveFreezeV1.t.sol)\n- [ProposalPayloadAaveFreezeV1](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposal-freeze-v1/blob/master/src/contracts/ProposalPayloadAaveFreezeV1.sol)\n- [Original discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategy-on-sunsetting-of-aave-v1/9450)\n- [Related discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-dao-policy-change-halt-listings-on-all-aave-v1-v2-non-permissioned-deployments/10831/6)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

While usually the concept of “protocol” is more related to the Aave v3 core, there are some complementary components of Aave v3 living on the periphery codebase, for example, the system managing external teams configuring rewards for Aave v3 activity (e.g. supply/borrow assets).\n\nSimilar to the majority of other Aave smart contracts, the ones on the periphery are upgradeable and controlled by the Aave governance, which means they are designed to be improved over time.\n\nGiven that the community has approved a new Aave v3 Ethereum, we have used the occasion to introduce light improvement/fixes on the periphery smart contracts and now will submit the upgrade to be approved via governance and it only makes sense to apply them to already existing v3 pools.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal executes `PoolAddressesProvider.setAddressAsProxy(keccak256(\"INCENTIVES_CONTROLLER\"), rewardsControllerImpl)` on `Polygon V3 pool`.\n\nIf this proposal succeeds, this will be seen as positive signaling to upgrade implementations for v3 pools on networks controlled by guardians as well.\n\nThe `RewardsController` contracts are deployed and initialized already:\n\n- [Polygon:RewardsController](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5f4d15d761528c57a5C30c43c1DAb26Fc5452731#code)\n- [Avalanche:RewardsController](https://snowtrace.io/address/0x5f4d15d761528c57a5C30c43c1DAb26Fc5452731#code)\n- [Optimism:RewardsController](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5f4d15d761528c57a5C30c43c1DAb26Fc5452731#code)\n- [Arbitrum:RewardsController](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5f4d15d761528c57a5C30c43c1DAb26Fc5452731#code)\n- [Fantom:RewardsController](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x5f4d15d761528c57a5C30c43c1DAb26Fc5452731#code) verification does not work properly\n- [Harmony:RewardsController](https://explorer.harmony.one/address/0x5f4d15d761528c57a5C30c43c1DAb26Fc5452731?activeTab=7) verification does not work properly\n\nVerification on harmony & fantom does not work due to bugs in the respective explorers.\nYou can verify though that bytecode & `initialize` calls are 100% the same between the different networks.\n\nFor guardian controlled pools the transactions are executed via gnosis, so instead of deploying a payload the guardians will just sign the `setAddressAsProxy(keccak256(\"INCENTIVES_CONTROLLER\"), rewardsControllerImpl)` transactions.\n\nThe pre-encoded calldata to be executed by guardians on the respective `PoolAddressesProvider`:\n\n- `0x5dcc528c0000000000000000000000005f4d15d761528c57a5c30c43c1dab26fc5452731`\n\n## References\n\n- [Polygon:UpgradeRewardsControllerPayload](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xf50a080aC535e531EC33cC05b227E910De2fb1fA)\n- [Test suite](https://github.com/bgd-labs/rewards-controller-update/tree/main/tests)\n- [UpgradeRewardsControllerPayload](https://github.com/bgd-labs/rewards-controller-update/blob/main/src/contracts/UpgradeRewardsControllerPayload.sol)\n- [Original discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-upgrade-of-aave-v3-periphery-to-3-0-1-across-networks/10744)\n- [Updated RewardsController contract](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-periphery/blob/master/contracts/rewards/RewardsController.sol)\n- [Update diffs](https://github.com/bgd-labs/rewards-controller-update/tree/main/diffs)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

It will be followed up with additional proposals to update risk parameters to reflect the current market conditions accurately.\n\nThe goal of this ARC is two-fold:\n\n- Reduce LTs → Reducing liquidation thresholds for USDC and DAI effectively reduces capital efficiency and increases the required capital for waging price manipulation attacks on Aave.\n- Encourage user migrations to v3 → This also begins to pave the way towards migrating to v3, where these assets can be utilized in E-mode.\n\nHowever, this is a significant change, and we wanted to present data to quantify and visualize the effect of such reductions on protocol users for community discussion.

The intent is to bridge the transition from v2 to v3 during this period with a finite end date and not continue on indefinitely. If there is still material TVL on v2 at the end of this period, we will discuss the appropriate next steps and maintenance/monitoring expectations with the community.\n\n---\n## Specification\n\nA full specification of the payload contract and tests enabling this mandate can be found on the Chaos Labs Github [here](https://github.com/ChaosLabsInc/aave-v2-payloads).\n\nIn summary, the proposal creates a 5-month stream of 175,000 aUSDC and 1242 AAVE ($75,000 using 30 day TWAP, calculated on day of proposal) starting on proposal execution to the Chaos-controlled address.\n\nThe Proposal Payload has been tested and peer-reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://twitter.com/bgdlabs), including simulations on mainnet of the whole proposal lifecycle.\n\n---\n## References\n\n- [Forum Post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-chaos-labs-aave-v2-coverage/11012)\n\n\n- [Tests](https://github.com/ChaosLabsInc/aave-v2-payloads/blob/main/src/tests/V2CoveragePaymentPayload.t.sol)\n- [Proposal payload implementation](https://github.com/ChaosLabsInc/aave-v2-payloads/blob/main/src/payloads/V2CoveragePaymentPayload.sol)\n- [Deployed proposal payload](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8922235734ec69e956977e2ea9774de8f614053a)\n\n---\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Maintaining supply caps that ensure that one user cannot subject the protocol to outsize risk is a key part of risk management for Aave v3 markets.\n\nThe supply cap can be revised lower if the community elects a more conservative approach. Regardless, the first step would be implementing an initial supply cap, which this proposal would accomplish.\n\n## Specification\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XYNLS1v.png)\n\n## Implementation\n\nA full specification of the payload contract and tests enabling this proposal can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-crosschain-listing-template).\n\n- Link to Payload implementation: [`AaveV3OptCapsPayload010423.sol`](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-crosschain-listing-template/blob/master/src/contracts/optimism/AaveV3OptCapsPayload010423.sol)\n- Link to Payload tests: [`AaveV3OptCapsPayload010423.t.sol`](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-crosschain-listing-template/blob/master/src/test/optimism/AaveV3OptCapsPayload010423.t.sol)\n- Link to deployed Payload: [`0x31976dc2ea27e75cc5a3687ed594d17127f9b72e`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x31976dc2ea27e75cc5a3687ed594d17127f9b72e)\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.

      "description": "\n\n## Author\n\nFounder of OP Labs and a director at Optimism Foundation\n\n## Forum post\n\n[Proposal to add OP as collateral on Aave V3 (On Optimism)](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-op-as-collateral-to-aave-v3/9087)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe proposal seeks to onboard the OP token as a collateral asset in Aave V3 on Optimism.\nThe Optimism Foundation could also seed incentives while the initial liquidity of the pool is bootstrapped.\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\nThe complete technical and risk parameters:\n\n- Loan-to-value: 30.00%\n- Liquidation threshold: 40.00%\n- Liquidation bonus: 10.00%\n- Price feed: OP/USD | Chainlink\n- A/S/V tokens (aToken/Variable/Stable): Standard implementation\n- Interest rate strategy: N/A\n- Borrowing enabled: No\n- Stable borrowing Enabled: No\n- Reserve Factor: 20.00%\n- Liquidation Protocol Fee: 10.00%\n- Debt Ceiling: 2M\n- Borrowable in Isolation: No\n- Supply Cap: 20M\n- Borrow Cap: N/A\n- eMode (efficiency mode): No\n- Unbacked Mint Cap: 0\n- Siloed Borrowing: N/A\n\n## Specifications\n\n**What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nCofounder of Optimism and a director at the Optimism Foundation\n\n**Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**\n\nOptimism is an EVM equivalent L2 scaling solution. The OP token is a governance token for the Optimism Collective.\nOP holders are currently able to vote on various decisions impacting the Collective, including the grants, protocol upgrades, inflation adjustments, and other fundamental changes.\nThe Collective is committed to an iterative governance system that will evolve dynamically over time.\nOptimism hopes to use the launch of this token to establish a deeper partnership between the Optimism and Aave communities.\nThis proposal would enable OP as collateral on AAVE V3 on Optimism.\n\n**Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nWith the recent release of the OP token, we want to bolster initial growth for Aave V3 on Optimism. This will benefit the Aave community by creating a vibrant ecosystem around Aave V3, while being a strong first use case for OP.\n\nAave would be one of the first platforms to support OP as collateral. The OP token is one of the first and leading rollup technology ecosystem tokens, so the Aave community would be supporting the scaling of Ethereum and onboard the cohort of users coming with it.\nL2s being the home for AAVE v3 could also gain a lot from this synergy.\n\nOverall, the use cases will create the opportunity to continue growing liquidity and usage of the Aave v3 pools on Optimism.\n\n**Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nInitially launched at the end of 2021, Optimism is an EVM equivalent L2 scaling solution. Optimism currently supports 100+ dapps and over $500m in on-chain value.\nOptimism drastically improves Ethereum’s scalability while retaining its security through rollup technology - having already saved its users over $1B in gas fees.\n\n**How is the asset currently used?**\n\nIt is used for governance on Optimism.\n\n**Emission schedule**\n\nAt genesis there was an initial total supply of 4,294,967,296 OP tokens. The total token supply is set to inflate at a rate of 2% per year, unless changed through governance.\n\n**Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.**\n\n**Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nThere is a multisig. It coontrols all funds in the chain. Members are anonymous in order to make the multisig more difficult to compromise.\n\n## Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n- Market Cap: ~$202M\n- 24h Volume: >$150M\n- Volatility: Low\n- Exchanges: Uniswap, Velodrome, Sushi\n- Maturity: Launched 5/31/21\n- Communities:\n- Discord - https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/\n- Twitter - https://twitter.com/OptimismFND\n- Mirror - https://optimism.mirror.xyz/\n- Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/optimismpbc\n\n- Date of deployment: May 31, 2021\n- Number of transactions: 12M\n- Number of holders: ~134k\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nOP has undergone audits.

      "description": "\n\n# Summary\n@llamaxyz proposes consolidating the Aave v2 Collector Contract holdings by swapping a portion of the long tail assets to USDC and redeeming assets from the Aave AMM deployment.\n\n# Abstract\nThe Aave v2 Collector Contract has accumulated a holding in several assets over time. Assets from the v1, v2, RWA, ARC, and AMM depoloyments all accumulate in the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract. This proposal is the first of several intended to consolidate the various Collector Contracts and Treasury holdings.\n\nThis proposal seeks to consolidate 17 assets in the v2 Ethereum Collector Contract to USDC and redeem ammTokens for the underlying assets.\n\n# Motivation\nThe DAO is currently accumulating over 60 assets in the v2 Collector Contract from various Aave deployments. Many of these holdings are of small economic value, are undercollateralized assets, or exhibit volatile pricing behaviour. Upon consolidating the DAO’s assets into USDC, which most of the DAO’s costs are denominated in, Llama intends to present the community with recommendations for deploying a portion of the larger holdings.\n\nThe AMM Liquidity Pool, v2, attracts very little capital and usage relative to other deployments. A number of the assets are frozen and, with v3 being deployed on Ethereum soon, it makes sense for the DAO to relocate this capital away from from the v2 AMM deployment. This proposal enables the following ammTokens, aAmmDAI, aAmmUSDC, aAmmUSDT, aAmmWBTC, and aAmmWETH to be redeemed periodically by calling a contract. Any actor will be able to interact with the contract via Etherscan. Llama, or anyone else, can redeem these ammTokens periodically with the underlying asset to be held within the v2 Collector Contract.\n\n# Specification\nThie following assets held within the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract are to be converted to USDC via swap contract.\n\n![long-tail asssets](https://i.imgur.com/2WY7n0o.png)\n\nUsers will be able to deposit USDC and receive the tokens mentioned in the table above, plus a small premium. The premium is expected to reimburse the cost incurred from swapping the applicable token to USDC along with associated gas costs. The methodology enables actors to support Aave in swapping one asset for another by creating an arbitrage opportunity in a decentralized manner.\n\nThe following assets are to be redeemed from the AMM deployment.\n\n![amm assets](https://i.imgur.com/e1WHaaM.png)\n\n# Implementation\nThe below outlines at a high level the flow of events this proposal will achieve:\n\nRedeem aTokens and ammTokens for underlying asset\nDeploy a Swap Contract whereby actors can deposit USDC and receive a selected token stated in the above table at the Chainlink Oracle price + premium\nv2 Collector Contract receives USDC\nTest cases can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-v2-collector-consolidation/blob/main/src/test/ProposalPayloadE2E.t.sol)\n\nPayload Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-v2-collector-consolidation/blob/main/src/ProposalPayload.sol)\n\nProposal Payload = [0xBefcd01681224555b74eAC87207eaF9Bc3361F59](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBefcd01681224555b74eAC87207eaF9Bc3361F59)\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n",

Aave Grants has also been a key driver of growth by awarding over $120k in Aave bounties across ten different hackathons, hosting three rAAVEs, and making other sponsorships to help proliferate the ghost. We are proposing to renew the program for the next two quarters by providing $3.25 million dollars ($1.625 million per quarter).\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave Grants DAO is a community-led grants program, focused on growing a thriving ecosystem of contributors within Aave through funding ideas, projects and events that benefit the ecosystem. We aim to drive development on top of Aave and ensure a constant influx of talented builders to maintain Aave’s long term growth. We help build culture and community around the Aave ecosystem that in turn attracts the best contributors.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThe full test of this proposal can be found [here.](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/test/proposals/aave-grants-dao-renewal/ProposalPayloadE2E.t.sol)\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis proposal includes a $3.25M approval of funds from the AaveEcosystemReserve and CollectorContract to the grants DAO multisig.\nThe funds are divided as follows:\n\n\nThis will allow the grants DAO to withdraw funds as needed and let the V2Collector to continue to earn interest in the meantime. The proposal payload will target the contract AaveEcosystemReserveController and call the function `function transfer(address collector, IERC20 token, address recipient, uint256 amount)` and `approve(address collector, IERC20 token, address recipient, uint256 amount)`.\n\n## References\n\nForum Post: [https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-aave-grants-dao-renewal/11289](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-aave-grants-dao-renewal/11289)\n\nSnapshot: [https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x194b68a5319b074065e38fcb0bd96e8e8b6ce15870844593e79750605a609109](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x194b68a5319b074065e38fcb0bd96e8e8b6ce15870844593e79750605a609109)\n\n**Target Contracts**\n\nProposalPayload = [0xe4621dfd503a533f42bb5a45162ea3e5233acd5f](\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xe4621dfd503a533f42bb5a45162ea3e5233acd5f)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis governance proposal activates the Aave V3 Ethereum pool (3.0.1), by completing all the initial setup and listing WBTC, WETH, wstETH, USDC, DAI, LINK, and AAVE, already pre-approved by the community.\nAll the Aave Ethereum V3 addresses can be found in the [aave-address-book](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-address-book/blob/main/src/AaveV3Ethereum.sol).\n\n# Motivation\n\nWhile AAVE V3 was deployed to various networks right after the release, the Ethereum pool was still running V2.\nAfter careful consideration, the community [decided to deploy a fresh V3](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x584eb4e0f79e1d9dcdd99b3a0c831bfc3c654af3f8f619d5f68eae23cd9cb149) instead of upgrading the V2 pool, for increased compatibility between the V3 pools and less general complexity.\nThe assets to be listed & respective configurations have been discussed in [the governance forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238) and been decided in the following [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xc31254fac1369090cea7c0105cbc6381b72189c038391996f855708ff2e0c02e).\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal's payload does the following:\n\n1. Create the eMode category for eth correlated assets via `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.setEModeCategory(1, 90_00, 93_00, 10_100, address(0), 'ETH correlated')`\n2. Swap of emergency admin to Aave Guardian via `ACL_MANAGER.removeEmergencyAdmin(AaveGovernanceV2.SHORT_EXECUTOR)` followed by `ACL_MANAGER.addEmergencyAdmin(GUARDIAN_ETHEREUM)`\n3. grant `POOL_ADMIN` permissions to all the asset listing stewards created inside the `constructor()` via `ACL_MANAGER.addPoolAdmin(stewards[i])`\n\nThe Steward pattern is taken from [V3-listing stewards](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-listing-stewards/blob/feat/v3-ethereum-tests/src/contracts/common/StewardBase.sol#L8). Each Steward will handle the listing of one specific asset and then renounce to the granted POOL_ADMIN role. This process is needed as otherwise, the proposal's gas limit would be really gas-expensive.\n\n## Configuration snapshot\n\nWhat you can see here is a formatted excerpt of the configuration snapshot with the relevant configurations after proposal execution.\nYou can find the full snapshot in the proposal [repository](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-ethereum-proposal/blob/main/reports/0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2_post-stewards-aave-v3-ethereum.md).\n\n### Reserve Configurations\n\n| symbol                                                                                 |    ltv | liqThreshold | liqBonus | liqProtocolFee | reserveFactor | borrowingEnabled |          supplyCap |          borrowCap |  eModeCategory | isFlashloanable |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----: | -----------: | -------: | -------------: | ------------: | ---------------: | -----------------: | -----------------: | -------------: | --------------- |\n| [WBTC](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599#code)   | 70.00% |       75.00% |    6.25% |            10% |           20% |             true |         43'000 BTC |         28'000 BTC |              -

      "description": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V2 ETH.\n\n## Abstract\n\nMany interest rate curves on Aave have not changed for a long time and, in the case of some assets, have never been updated for the lifetime of the asset listing. Given the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet has evaluated assets on Aave and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAmong other factors, there are two primary reasons to adjust an interest rate curve:\n\n1. mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool\n2. build reserves via protocol revenue to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DUQtK7a.png)\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the interest rate strategy contract used by `TUSD` and `USDT` using the `setReserveInterestRateStrategyAddress` call on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract, and sets the reserve factor of `TUSD` by using the `setReserveFactor` method on the same.\n\nThe interest rate strategy contracts have been deployed and verified:\n  - For TUSD: [`0x6bcE15B789e537f3abA3C60CB183F0E8737f05eC`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6bcE15B789e537f3abA3C60CB183F0E8737f05eC)\n  - For USDT: [`0x33DeAc0861FD6a9235b86172AA939E79085c6f52`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x33DeAc0861FD6a9235b86172AA939E79085c6f52)\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.

      "description": "\n\n# Summary\n\nLlama presents a proposal to amend the interest rate parameters, SupplyCap, and BorrowCap for wMATIC on the Aave Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nAt the current borrowing rate of 6.11%, the maximised yield strategy of looping stMATIC/wMATIC is non profitable without incentives. wMATIC’s reserve utilisation is low, 38.15%, due to high borrowing costs. \n\nThis proposal will reduce the borrowing cost of wMATIC by reducing the overall borrowing cost to users and will also improve capital efficiency by enabling a great portion of the liquidity to be borrowed. This is expected to lead to increased wMATIC demand and greater revenue to Aave.\n\nThe up and coming liquidity mining campaign is expected to lead to a material inflow of deposits and an increase in borrowing demand. This proposal, amongst others, helps prepare Aave for an influx of new users. \n\n# Motivation\n\nWith wMATIC borrowing costs exceeding the yield of MaticX and stMATIC, users are unlikely to enter into the Matic eMode without financial incentive. Upon review of the wMATIC reserve, the Uoptimal parameter set at 45% means users can borrow up to 45% of the wMATIC in the reserve before borrowing costs become more volatile.\n\nIncreasing the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 75% will enable users to borrow 30% more wMATIC in the reserve for the same borrowing rate, Slope1. By reducing the Slope1 parameter from 7.0% to 6.1%,  the borrowing cost at the Uoptimal point is lowered. \n\nTo reduce the volatility in the borrow rate above Uoptimal utilisation, this proposal intends to reduce the Slope2 parameter from 300% to 100%. This will lower the borrowing cost volatility when utilisation exceeds the Upotimal point.\n\nThis initial update of increasing the Uoptimal and lowering the Slope1 parameter improves the overall capital efficiency and makes borrowing more attractive to users. Future updates will further optimise the interest rate.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aave/aip/main/content/assets/WMATIC_INTEREST_RATE_UPDATE_V3_POLYGON/graph.png)\n\nIn addition to the interest rate updates proposed above, Chaos Labs has provided revised SupplyCap and BorrowCap parameters. By increasing the amount of wMATIC that can be deposited and borrowed, the recursive yield maximising strategy can grow beyond the current limitation of the reserve during the upcoming liquidity mining program.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the wMATIC Reserve. \n\n|Parameter|Current|Proposed|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|SupplyCap|32.88M|47M|\n|BorrowCap|9.23M|39.95M|\n|Uoptimal|45%|75%|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7.0%|6.1%|\n|Slope2|300%|100%|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|20%|\n\n\n# Implementation\n\nTest cases can be found [here](https://github.com/defijesus/aave-v3-wmatic-interest-rate-upgrade/blob/master/src/test/polygon/PolygonWmaticE2E.t.sol)\n\nPayload Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/defijesus/aave-v3-wmatic-interest-rate-upgrade/blob/master/src/contracts/polygon/WmaticPayload.sol)\n\nNew Interest Rate Strategy deployment script can be found [here](https://github.com/defijesus/wmatic-interest-rate-strategy-deployer-v3/blob/main/script/DeployContract.s.sol)\n\nProposal Payload deployed address can be found [here](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x7255791f9b2d44863c21ed1f484d444a74731ac6)\n\nInterest Rate Strategy deployed address can be found [here](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xFB0898dCFb69DF9E01DBE625A5988D6542e5BdC5)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). \n",

      "description": "\n\n# Summary\n\n[Llama](https://twitter.com/llama) presents a proposal to amend BAL interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2, Polygon v3 and Polygon v2 Liquidity Pools.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThere is currently a high demand for borrowing BAL (borrow rate = 46.7% on Polygon v3) across all Reserves. This proposal will improve the capital efficiency of the BAL pools by increasing the SupplyCap, BorrowCap, and Uoptimal parameters. \n\nThe interest rate curves across all Aave deployments will be the same, with Polygon v3 expected to offer higher returns relative to Polygon v2 and hopefully entice users to migrate to v3. This proposal is expected to increase Aave’s BAL-denominated revenue whilst offering users greater capital efficiency.\n\nDue to incentives offered by Aura Finance and others, strong borrowing demand is expected to continue in light of increased borrowing costs. For example, depositing BAL into Aura Finance’s staking contract generates [42.2%](https://app.aura.finance/) at the time of writing.\n\n# Motivation\n\nDue to strong borrowing demand for BAL, the reserve utilization often exceeds the Uoptimal parameter on active reserves, causing the borrowing rate to be volatile. The chart below shows the volatility in BAL borrowing rates on the only non-frozen BAL reserve, Polygon v3.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uq7xpvB.png)\n\nBy increasing the Uoptimal parameter, a greater portion of the BAL reserve can be borrowed by users without experiencing such volatility borrowing rates, providing the BorrowCap is accommodative. This proposal will improve the capital efficiency of the reserves by increasing the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 80%.\n\nDue to the high borrowing demand for BAL, which often exceeds 20%, it is fair to conclude that the borrowing rate for BAL is set too low. This proposal introduces a Base 3.0% and increases the Slope1 parameter from 7.0% to 14.0%. The borrowing cost at the Uoptimal point is 17.0% (Base + Slope1) on the proposed curve compared to 7.0% on the existing curve.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/faD4z5r.png)\n\nWith Aave receiving 20% of all fee revenue, this will lead to increased BAL nominated revenue. \n\nIn addition to the interest rate curve changes, this proposal will also increase the BorrowCap from 156.3K BAL to 256.140K BAL. Revising the BorrowCap higher will enable users to benefit from the increased the Uoptimal parameter. Do note, the BorrowCap figure was provided by Chaos Labs. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the BAL Interest Rate on Ethereum v2, Polygon v2 and Polygon v3.\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | ---: | ---: |\n|Uoptimal|45|80|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|150|\n|Reserve Factor|20|20|\n\nThe below shows the proposed changes to the Borrow Cap on Polygon v3.\n\n|Polygon Parameter| Units |\n| --- | --- | \n| Supply Cap | 284,600 (no change)|\n| Borrow Cap | 256,140 |\n\nBorrow Cap is calculated: \n(Uoptimal + 0.1) x SupplyCap\n(0.8+0.1) x 284,600 = 256,140\n\n# Implementation\n\nTest cases can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-bal-interest-rate-updates/blob/main/src/test/ProposalPayloadE2E.t.sol)\n\nPayload Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-bal-interest-rate-updates/tree/main/src)\n\nProposal Payload deployed address can be found [here] (https://etherscan.io/address/0x3b6532efb7a60711f8f3fa77a589a726c836f4cf)\nProposal Payload for Polygon deployed address can be found [here] (https://polygonscan.com/address/0x98bc9dfa3cecb37f1bdeadc6e774d39082756b19)\n\nInterest Rate Strategy deployed address can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x04c28D6fE897859153eA753f986cc249Bf064f71)\nInterest Rate Strategy deployed address for Polygon v2 can be found [here](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x80cb7e9E015C5331bF34e06de62443d070FD6654)\nInterest Rate Strategy deployed address for Polygon v3 can be found [here](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x4b8D3277d49E114C8F2D6E0B2eD310e29226fe16)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

      "description": "\n\n# Simple Summary\n\n[Llama](https://twitter.com/llama) recommends aligning the wETH interest rate parameters across the Aave v2 and v3 Ethereum Liquidity Pools.\n\n# Abstract\n\nSince the recent wETH parameter upgrade on v2, Aave has experienced improved overall revenue. However, TVL and daily revenue are gradually declining. \n\nThis proposal intends to adjust the v2 wETH interest rate curve to match the v3 wETH interest rate curve which is expected to lead to high utilization of the v2 wETH reserve and partially offset the emerging declining week on week revenue trend.\n\n# Motivation\n\nSince AIP 131 was implemented, the amount of stETH deposited as collateral to borrow wETH has been fairly consistent. However, the amount of wETH borrowed by users who deposited stETH as collateral has reduced from 515.21K to 413.74K between 18th December 2022 and 15th January 2023 (pre Aave v3 launch). The tapering of borrowing demand is reflected in Aave’s wETH nominated revenue figures as shown below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/T2Q2eFt.png)\n\nThe market is indicating that there is insufficient demand for borrowing wETH. Three possible reasons are shown below:\n\n* Structured products charge a fee\n* Additional smart contract risk\n* Elevated exposure to DEX liquidity\n\nOur analysis indicates the Slope1, 5.75%, is most likely the primary causes of the reduced wETH demand. Lowering the Slope1 parameter will enable users to achieve a higher return from entering the recursive loop strategy. The chart below shows how users that deposit stETH and borrow wETH have behaved to date. The date highlighted below is the date AIP131 was executed.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Kylzpy7.png)\n\nThis proposal intends to reduce the Slope1 parameters on the v2 market to 3.8% and introduce a Base of 1%. The borrowing rate at the Upotimal point is reduced from 5.75% to 4.8% (Base + Slope1). Introducing a Base, with a Lower Slope1 (4.8% < 5.75%) parameter, acts to reduce the gradient between 0% < Utilization < Uoptimal compared to having a Slope1 = Base + Lower Slope1. \n\nThe graphic below shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curves. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LoYlee2.png)\n\nThe graphic below shows the proposed interest rate with Base, Slope1 and Slope2 parameters detailed. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/a7WZRKR.png)\n\nIt is worth noting that borrowing wETH becomes slightly more expensive at lower utilization compared to the current wETH interest rate. When utilization is less than 41% borrowing costs are higher, ranging 0 to 0.98%, and when utilization is greater than 41% borrowing costs are lower, ranging 0 to 0.95%. Current utilization is 46% on the v2 deployment which means the borrowing costs would be reduced.\n\nThe chart below shows the relative change in borrowing costs for users, comparing the current versus the proposed interest rate curve.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UnKydnQ.png)\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curve for the Ethereum v2 deployment.\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|80.00|80.00|\n|Base|0.00|1.00|\n|Variable Slope1|5.75|3.80|\n|Variable Slope2|80.00|80.00|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00|15.00|\n|Stable Slope1|4.00|4.00|\n|Stable Slope2|80.00|80.00|\n\n# Implementation\n\nTest cases can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/master/src/test/mainnet/AaveV2wETHIRPayloadTest.t.sol)\n\nPayload Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/master/src/contracts/mainnet/AaveV2wETHIRPayload.sol)\n\nNew Interest Rate Strategy deployment script can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-interest-rate-strategy-deployer/tree/main/script)\n\nProposal Payload deployed address can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfb2a7eb134fa2d03d9a2c8fe0a9758132fe15357)\n\nInterest Rate Strategy deployed address can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb8975328Aa52c00B9Ec1e11e518C4900f2e6C62a)\n\n# Security Considerations\n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\n# Governance Considerations\n\nAave [governance forum discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-weth-wsteth-interest-rate-curve-ethereum-network/11372), [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x9ae28e9c82c5fc0d24cf1df788094e959d99f906d11b89e455a60ee16b071d6f) and [Risk Service Provider feedback](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-weth-wsteth-interest-rate-curve-ethereum-network/11372/4).\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal changes the current price feed for xSushi (adapter) to a Chainlink calculated oracle, on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, a custom [price feed](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9b26214bEC078E68a394AaEbfbffF406Ce14893F) is used for xSushi, which calculates the price based on `SUSHI / ETH` oracle and `SUSHI / xSUSHI` ratio on-chain. It is more effective in terms of technical support and gas cost to use the [feed](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF05D9B6C08757EAcb1fbec18e36A1B7566a13DEB) deployed by Chainlink, which does this calculations off-chain. In addition, any risk of on-chain manipulation, even if not applicable at the moment with the asset not enabled for borrowing, gets removed.\n\n## Specification\n\nUpon execution the proposal will:\n\n- call `ORACLE.setAssetSources(0x8798249c2E607446EfB7Ad49eC89dD1865Ff4272, 0xF05D9B6C08757EAcb1fbec18e36A1B7566a13DEB)` to replace the price source for xSushi\n\n## Security and additional considerations\n\nTo have extra assurances on the feed swap, we did the following:\n\n- **Historical Feeds Comparison**: Comparing the answers from the current feed with the new one for the last year with a 2-hour step gave the following results:\n  - 24.88% of results differ for less than 0.1%\n  - 55.63% have between 0.1% and 1% difference\n  - 19.49% is between 1% and 2%\n\nPrice deviation for both feeds is 2%, which means that the price difference is withing the norm.\n\n## References\n\n- [AaveV2SwapxSushiPriceFeedPayload](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-crosschain-listing-template/blob/master/src/contracts/mainnet/AaveV2SwapxSushiPriceFeedPayload.sol)\n- [Test suite](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-crosschain-listing-template/blob/master/src/test/mainnet/AaveV2SwapxSushiPriceFeedPayloadTest.t.sol)\n\n## Contracts\n\n- [xSushi](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8798249c2E607446EfB7Ad49eC89dD1865Ff4272)\n- [Current price feed](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9b26214bEC078E68a394AaEbfbffF406Ce14893F)\n- [Chainlink's price feed](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF05D9B6C08757EAcb1fbec18e36A1B7566a13DEB)\n- [AaveV2SwapxSushiPriceFeedPayload: ProposalPayload](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3105c276558dd4cf7e7be71d73be8d33bd18f211)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n# Summary\n\nThis ARFC presents the community with the opportunity to add wstETH to the Arbitrum V3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nAcross the Aave Liquidity Pools, stETH is listed on Aave v2 Ethereum and wstETH is listed on Aave v3 Ethereum and recently Optimism. This proposal seeks to list wstETH on the Arbitrum Liquidity Pool as Collateral, with Borrowing enabled and an Ethereum eMode.  \n\nThe stETH/wETH rewards-maximising loop on Aave v2 is the main source of borrowing demand for wETH and the wETH reserve generates a material portion of Aave’s revenue, more than $281k in January 2023. By listing wstETH on Arbitrum users will be able to enter the same recursive strategy creating borrowing demand for wETH and revenue for Aave.\n \nThe risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet, Chaos Labs and Llama, with this post using the parameters agreed between the two service providers.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe stETH reserve on Aave v2 is the largest reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.65B in deposits, exceeding USDC ($0.86B) and ETH ($1.47B). This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximising strategy. \n\nDemand for borrowing wETH on Aave v2 Ethereum increased significantly when stETH was listed as collateral. InstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO, CIAN and others have all built products on top of Aave v2 that utilise the rewards-maximising stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Arbitrum Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Arbitrum. This is expected to create borrowing demand for wETH and boost Aave’s revenue.\n\nThe charts below show the effect of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum liquidity pool. stETH drives most of the wETH borrowing demand and resulting wETH fee-revenue. The wETH reserve generated approximately $217k in revenue during December and generated $281k by late January.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gjsCIuk.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EbBLhI5.png)\n\nListing of stETH by Aave has enabled Aave to offer the best return on wETH, in wETH terms, across major lending markets, continually outperforming Compound. By listing wstETH on Arbitrum, the Aave community is helping create an environment capable of replicating the success of the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis section presents the risk parameters and interest rates parameters as discussed on the governance forum.

      "description": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V3 OP.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThese parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aavev3_optimism) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n## Supporting Data on Aave V3 Optimism\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ aggregate positions**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/z2TdjKA.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XSupkvw.png)\n\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2QUPmL2.png)\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BQnmfRJ.png)\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis cross-chain proposal executes a pre-deployed optimism payload contract: [`0x6bce15b789e537f3aba3c60cb183f0e8737f05ec`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x6bce15b789e537f3aba3c60cb183f0e8737f05ec)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.

Consequently, given the requests from members of the community affected, we have come up with a plan to “rescue” those funds, providing the affected people a way to recover them.\n\nThis initial phase will affect the following:\n\n- Users who sent[AAVE](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9), [LEND](https://etherscan.io/token/0x80fB784B7eD66730e8b1DBd9820aFD29931aab03), [USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7) and [UNI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984) to the [AAVE](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9) token smart contract\n- Users who sent [LEND](https://etherscan.io/token/0x80fB784B7eD66730e8b1DBd9820aFD29931aab03) to the [LEND](https://etherscan.io/token/0x80fB784B7eD66730e8b1DBd9820aFD29931aab03) smart contract\n- User who sent [LEND](https://etherscan.io/token/0x80fB784B7eD66730e8b1DBd9820aFD29931aab03) to the [LendToAaveMigrator](https://etherscan.io/address/0x317625234562B1526Ea2FaC4030Ea499C5291de4) smart contract\n- Users who sent [AAVE](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9) and [stkAAVE](https://etherscan.io/token/0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5) to the [stkAAVE](https://etherscan.io/token/0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5) contract\n\nThe LEND sent to the specified contracts will be claimed already as AAVE tokens with the transformation LEND to AAVE already taken into account (1 AAVE = 100 LEND)\n\n## Specification\n\nFor wallets to be able to claim the tokens they sent to the contracts specified on Phase 1, we have created a different Merkle tree for every claimable token (AAVE, stkAAVE, UNI, USDT).\n\nWith the roots and amounts, every wallet will be able to claim by calling the AaveMerkleDistributor contract.\n\nThis Rescue Short Proposal will be in charge of the activation of the AaveMerkleDistributor contract and the rescue of LEND sent to the LendToAaveMigrator and to LEND contracts.\n\n- ProposalPayloadShort: This proposal payload will deploy the AaveMerkleDistributor contract and add the AAVE, USDT, UNI and stkAAVE distributions. It will also connect the new implementation of the LendToAaveMigrator. The LendToAaveMigrator will be initialized with the deployed AaveMerkleDistributor and with the LEND amount calculated by adding:\n    - LEND amount sent to LendToAaveMigrator: 8007719287288096435418 LEND in WEI (~8007,72 LEND).\n    - LEND amount sent to LEND contract: 841600717506653731350931 LEND in WEI (~841600,72 LEND).<p>\nThis amount will directly be accounted by rescuing AAVE, as the LEND contract will not be updated, but as the LendToAaveMigrator has all remaining AAVE, we can assume that it was sent there, and so it can be migrated with the rest of the LEND amount sent.\n## References\n\nA list of relevant links like for this proposal:\n\n- [forum discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-rescue-of-tokens-locked-on-aave-overview-and-phase-1/8150/1)\n- [tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/rescue-mission-phase-1/tree/master/test) \n- Contracts:\n  - [ProposalPayloadShort](https://github.com/bgd-labs/rescue-mission-phase-1/blob/master/src/contracts/ProposalPayloadShort.sol)\n  - [LendToAaveMigrator Implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/rescue-mission-phase-1/blob/master/src/contracts/LendToAaveMigrator.sol)\n  - [AaveMerkleDistributor](https://github.com/bgd-labs/rescue-mission-phase-1/blob/master/src/contracts/AaveMerkleDistributor.sol)\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nThe contracts have been audited by Certora, and the report can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/rescue-mission-phase-1/tree/master/certora)\n\nImplementation diffs have been generated to see that the new implementations only differ on the rescue logic:\n\n- LendToAaveMigrator [Diff](https://github.com/bgd-labs/rescue-mission-phase-1/blob/master/diffs/LendToAaveMigrator-diff.md)\n\nStorage layouts diffs have also been generated for the contracts where the implementation is updated:\n\n- LendToAaveMigrator storage layout [Diff](https://github.com/bgd-labs/rescue-mission-phase-1/blob/master/diffs/rescue_LendToAaveMigrator_layout_diff.md)\n\n## Deployed Contracts\n- [ProposalPayloadShort](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4A4c73d563395ad827511F70097d4Ef82E653805)\n- [LendToAaveMigrator Implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7b62461a3570c6AC8a9f8330421576e417B71EE7)\n- [AaveMerkleDistributor](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa88c6D90eAe942291325f9ae3c66f3563B93FE10)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Enabling borrowing, with a reasonable BorrowCap and SD rewards, is expected to generate significant utilisation of the MaticX reserve. \n\nThis proposal facilitates the expansion of MaticX yield based strategies on Aave v3 Polygon by creating more favourable bootstrapping conditions. The introduction of liquidity mining rewards is expected to drive notable inflows and usage to the v3 deployment. \n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions on Aave v3 Polygon to facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. The below proposals details are applicable:\n\n* [Proposal to add MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/79950)\n* [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-polygon-wmatic-interest-rate-update/10290)\n* [ARFC SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sd-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10658)\n* [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632)\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the above work.\n\nIn support of the ongoing SD rewards distribution, this proposal seeks to increase the SupplyCap, enable borrowing and introduce a BorrowCap sufficient to create a notable deposit yield.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GSWOAxP.png)\n\nDetailed analysis can be found on the governance forum, [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555).\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters are being proposed and have been reviewed by [Gauntlet](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555/6).\n\n|Parameter|Current|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |---|\n|Loan To Value|50.00%|58.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|65.00%|67.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|0.00%|10.00%|\n|SupplyCap|6.0M units|8.6M units|\n|Borrowing|Disabled|Enabled|\n|BorrowingCap|0.00M units|5.20M units|\n\nWith borrowing to be enabled, the following interest rate parameters have been reviewed by Llama and Gauntlet.\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Base|0.25%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Slope1|4.00%|\n|Slope2|150.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing |Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1 |0.50%|\n|Stable Slope2 |150.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset |2.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00%|\n\n# Implementation\n\nTest cases can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/master/src/test/polygon/AaveV3PolMaticXRiskParamsUpdatePayloadTest.t.sol)\n\nPayload Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/master/src/contracts/polygon/AaveV3PolMaticXRiskParamsUpdatePayload.sol)\n\nNew Interest Rate Strategy deployment script can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-interest-rate-strategy-deployer/tree/main/script)\n\nProposal Payload deployed address can be found [here](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x46a1b7d4a2920270c7eb2c2db4df2259a109bcb4)\n\nInterest Rate Strategy deployed address can be found [here](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x6B434652E4C4e3e972f9F267982F05ae0fcc24b6)\n\n# Security Considerations\n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\n# Governance Considerations\n\nAave [governance forum discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555), [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x8abe6a2ae1134d6886f460d6648dc3a5d2f789e1b94e78f496e7f5ec5ff38697) and [Risk Service Provider feedback](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555/6).\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

The chart below shows how deposit rates on this deployment have been affect by the freezing and disabling borrowing on Polygon v2 and Ethereum v2 respectively during late November 2022. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VDtUak2.png)\n\nBy listing CRV on v3 Ethereum and with a suitable BorrowCap in place, users will have the ability to migrate there positions from v2 to v3. \n\nAny CRV earned by Aave can be used in a number of different ways, with examples shown below:\n\n* Treasury yield\n* GHO adoption\n* StakedAToken adoption\n* Support Safety Module yield\n\nHow the CRV will be used is open for discuss and implementation via a separate proposal.\n\nThe risk parameters presented have been reviewed by Gauntlet and a supportive comment can be found on the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-crv-to-ethereum-v3/11532/5).\n\nThe interest rate curve parameters have been sourced from Llama's [ARFC CRV Interest Rate Curve Upgrade post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-crv-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/11337) and have also been reviewed by Gauntlet. \n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: CRV\n\nContract Address: [0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52](https://etherscan.io/token/0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52)\n\n|Risk Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|YES|\n|Enable Borrow|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|\n|Loan To Value|55.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|61.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|8.30%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Borrow Cap|7.70M|\n|Supply Cap|62.50M|\n|Debt Ceiling|20.90M|\n|Variable Base|3.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|14.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|70.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|8.00%|\n|Stable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|\n\n# Implementation\n\nTest cases can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/master/src/test/mainnet/AaveV3EthAddCRVPoolPayloadTest.t.sol)\n\nPayload Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/master/src/contracts/mainnet/AaveV3EthAddCRVPoolPayload.sol)\n\nProposal Payload deployed address can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5594475f068f814bdeb2d21b1676431a376322f5)\n\nInterest Rate Strategy deployed address can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x76884cAFeCf1f7d4146DA6C4053B18B76bf6ED14)\n\n# Security Considerations\n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\n# Governance Considerations\n\nAave [governance forum discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-crv-to-ethereum-v3/11532), [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xa0b5336692735fb4288537646aec5819cb4cbf01fc3a8a7cb06c9e62db708055) and [Risk Service Provider feedback](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-crv-to-ethereum-v3/11532/5).\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

      "description": "\n\n# Summary\n\nLlama proposes increasing the stMATIC Supply Cap on Polygon to facilitate an expansion of the stMATIC/wMATIC loop strategy. \n\n# Abstract\n\nThe utilisation of the stMATIC reserve has reached 100% and this proposal seeks to increase the SupplyCap to 15M units up from 7.5M units.  \n\nIncreasing the SupplyCap will enable users to deposit stMATIC and enter the recursive stMATIC/wMATIC yield strategy.  \n\nLido DAO currently has the ability to distribute LDO rewards on the Polygon v3 deployment. Due to the stMATIC SupplyCap being reached there is little to no incentive for Lido DAO to distribute LDO rewards. This proposal seeks to encourage Lido DAO to distribute LDO rewards, as early as March on the Aave v3 Polygon liquidity pools.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions on Aave v3 Polygon to facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. The below proposals details are applicable to stMATIC:\n\n* [Proposal: Add Support for stMATIC (Lido)](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-add-support-for-stmatic-lido/7677)\n* [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-polygon-wmatic-interest-rate-update/10290)\n* [ARFC LDO Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-ldo-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10575)\n* [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632)\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the above work.\n\nAnalysis performed by [Gauntlet](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-methodologies-borrow-and-supply-cap/11487) generated a conservative and aggressive SupplyCap ceiling of 16.17M and 24.26M units respectively.  \n\nChaos Lab's supports increasing the SupplyCap to 15M units. This follows the general rule of thumb that SupplyCap should not be more than doubled in any single proposal.\n\nAs Chaos Lab's recommendation is less than the maximum conservative SupplyCap presented by Gauntlet's methodology, Llama proposes increasing the SupplyCap to 15M SupplyCap.\n\nWith reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/1) it is possible to ship several upgrades to gradually increasing Aave's exposure to stMATIC over time.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters being proposed have been reviewed by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs.\n\nTicker: stMATIC\n\nContract: [`polygon: 0x3a58a54c066fdc0f2d55fc9c89f0415c92ebf3c4`](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x3a58a54c066fdc0f2d55fc9c89f0415c92ebf3c4)\n\n|Parameter|Current Value|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|SupplyCap|7.5M units|15M units|\n\n# Implementation\n\nA list of relevant links like for this proposal:\n\n* [Governance Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-stmatic-supply-cap/12038)\n* [Test Cases](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/master/src/test/polygon/AaveV3PolSTMATICCapUpdatePayloadTest.t.sol)\n* [Payload Implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/master/src/contracts/polygon/AaveV3PolSTMATICCapUpdatePayload.sol)\n* [Deployed Contracts](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xaa7ef2f9b31fa26e802ca9b3e33990ada4143fb9#code)\n\nChaos Labs and Gauntlet both contributed to the development of the ARFC forum post. \n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n",

In addition, these changes will act as an effective motivation to shift usage to V3, where users can enjoy the benefits of enhanced risk mitigation mechanisms.\n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. To minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings by a series of incremental decreases, following the Risk-Off Framework previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP.\n\nTo avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will communicate the planned amendments before their on-chain execution via all available avenues (Twitter, forums, Nansen Connect, and Blockscan Chat).\n\nBelow, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users.\n\nAt the time of this proposal, none of the current positions will be eligible for liquidation due to the proposed change.\n\n$MKR\nZero (0) accounts are eligible for liquidation.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameter proposal is presented below:\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recommended | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MKR | Liquidation Threshold | 67% | 64% | -3% |\n| MKR | Loan-to-Value | 62% | 59% | -3% |\n\n\n# References\n[Forum Post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-mkr-on-aave-v2-ethereum-2023-02-17/11948)\n\n[Tests](https://github.com/ChaosLabsInc/aave-v2-payloads/blob/main/src/tests/MKRPayload-Feb26.t.sol)\n\n[Proposal payload implementation](https://github.com/ChaosLabsInc/aave-v2-payloads/blob/main/src/payloads/MKRPayload-Feb26.sol)\n\n[Deployed proposal payload](https://etherscan.io/address/0x014b2fc091cad41f5d6a8eeb2fef27852f4a97e7#code) \n\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nLlama presents a proposal to update the CRV interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2, Polygon v3, and Polygon v2 Liquidity Pools.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe CRV SupplyCap on the Polygon v3 deployment is currently at 100% with borrowing costs of 5.02% with a Utilization of 31.51% relative to a 45% Uoptimal value, [1]. This proposal intends to increase the CRV SupplyCap on Polygon v3 deployment, improve the capital efficiency of each liquidity pool, and increase the amount of revenue generated across the various CRV reserves.\n\nCapital efficiency is improved on active reserves by increasing the Uoptimal value. Revenue is increased by introducing a Base interest rate, increasing the Slope1 and aligning the Reserve Factor to 20% across all pools. \n\nThis AIP is expected to lead more CRV revenue and significantly reduce the amount of free CRV in active reserves.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith the CRV reserve on Polygon reaching its SupplyCap, this is an ideal time to implement an upgrade that addresses the SupplyCap and Interest Rate parameters. \n\nThe current CRV Interest Rate reflects the original parameters implemented when the liquidity pools were deployed. The Interest Rate Parameters do not take into consideration the alternative use cases for CRV and consequently, Aave has missed out on revenue from the sustained borrowing demand.\n\nLlama expects the sustained borrowing demand to continue due to Curve's veTokenomics presenting several opportunities for CRV borrowers to earn yield. \n\nIn this proposal, the Uoptimal parameter is to be increased from 45% to 70%, which improves the capital efficiency of active reserves.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BhKxsuS.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GZNc30u.png)\n\nSpecific to the Polygon v3 deployment, increasing the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 70% will lead to an increase in the BorrowCap, which is a function of the SupplyCap and Uoptimal parameter.\n\nBorrowCap = SupplyCap * (Uoptimal + 0.1)\n\nThe new SupplyCap parameter has been prepared by Chaos Labs, 1,125.24K. This generates a new Borrow Cap of 900.19K, [2].\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VDtUak2.png)\n\nThe interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/g0jtJql.png)\n\nThis proposal recommends introducing a Base and increasing the Slope1 parameter to 3% and 14% respectively.  This will lead to a substantial change to the current curve. Over time, we will monitor the reserve and amend the Slope1 parameter to optimize for risk exposure and revenue generation.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WMT8KMn.png)\n\nThe Reserve Factor on Polygon v3 is to be increased from 10% to 20%, bringing it in line with all other Aave deployments.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the CRV Reserve on Polygon v3, Polygon v2 and Ethereum v2.\n\n**Polygon v3 - Active**\n\n|Parameter|Current|Proposed|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|SupplyCap|937,700 units|1,125,240 units|\n|BorrowCap|640,440 units|900,190 units|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|70.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|3.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|14.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|300.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|10.00%|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|0.00%|8.00%|\n|Stable Slope2|0.00%|300.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|2.00%|3.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|5.00%|5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|20.00%|\n\n**Polygon v2 - Frozen**\n\n|Parameter|Current |Proposed|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|45.00%|\n|Base|0.00%|3.00%|\n|VariableSlope1|7.00%|14.00%|\n|VariableSlope2|300.00%|300.00%|\n|StableSlope1|10.00%|17.00%|\n|StableSlope2|300.00%|300.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|20.00%|\n\n**Ethereum v2 - Frozen**\n\n|Parameter|Current|Proposed|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|45.00%|\n|Base|0.00%|3.00%|\n|VariableSlope1|7.00%|14.00%|\n|VariableSlope2|300.00%|300.00%|\n|StableSlope1|10.00%|17.00%|\n|StableSlope2|300.00%|300.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|20.00%|\n\n# Implementation\n\n**Polygon v3**\n\nTest cases can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-crv-interest-rate-updates/blob/main/src/test/ProposalPayloadV3E2E.t.sol)\n\nPayload Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-crv-interest-rate-updates/blob/main/src/ProposalPayloadPolygon.sol)\n\nNew Interest Rate Strategy deployment script can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-interest-rate-strategy-deployer-v3/tree/main/script)\n\nProposal Payload deployed address can be found [here](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x3b6532efb7a60711f8f3fa77a589a726c836f4cf)\n\nInterest Rate Strategy deployed address can be found [here](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xBefcd01681224555b74eAC87207eaF9Bc3361F59)\n\n**Polygon v2**\n\nTest cases can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-crv-interest-rate-updates/blob/main/src/test/ProposalPayloadV2E2E.t.sol)\n\nPayload Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-crv-interest-rate-updates/blob/main/src/ProposalPayloadPolygon.sol)\n\nNew Interest Rate Strategy deployment script can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-interest-rate-strategy-deployer/tree/main/script)\n\nProposal Payload deployed address can be found [here](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x3b6532efb7a60711f8f3fa77a589a726c836f4cf)\n\nInterest Rate Strategy deployed address can be found [here](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x334c59E5a50932a3C34AC39AB12131C648Cc1aE8)\n\n**Ethereum v2**\n\nTest cases can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-crv-interest-rate-updates/blob/main/src/test/ProposalPayloadV2E2E.t.sol)\n\nPayload Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-crv-interest-rate-updates/blob/main/src/ProposalPayload.sol)\n\nNew Interest Rate Strategy deployment script can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-interest-rate-strategy-deployer/tree/main/script)\n\nProposal Payload deployed address can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbacbe678e2c59343024fd5755262c7b0f77867d1)\n\nInterest Rate Strategy deployed address can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5E6EFF5bEFe97c8b87BEa94F6e9940156CC47027)\n\n\n# Security Considerations\n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\n# Governance Considerations\n\nAave [governance forum discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-crv-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/11337), [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x56aaf192f5cad8277b0e7c82abad030c62bb8fcfe4f2640ce5b896ab04397c20) and [Risk Service Provider feedback](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-crv-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/11337/9).\n\n# References\n\n1. https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x172370d5cd63279efa6d502dab29171933a610af&marketName=proto_polygon_v3\n2. https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v3-borrow-caps-methodology/10925\n3. https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

This means that the circulating supply of BUSD will trend towards zero over time.

This proposal seeks to encourage Stader Labs to continue distributing SD rewards by increasing the Supply Cap and enabling more MaticX to be deposited into Aave. \n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions conducive to growing TVL and Revenue by facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. \n\nThe below details various proposals reflecting Llama's efforts to date:\n\n* [Proposal to add MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/79950)\n* [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-polygon-wmatic-interest-rate-update/10290)\n* [ARFC SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sd-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10658)\n* [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632)\n* [ARFC MaticX Polygon v3 Upgrade](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555)\n\nAfter executing the [ARFC MaticX Polygon v3 Upgrade](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555) proposal, within 24hrs, the Supply Cap of 8.6M has nearly been reached.  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3xB9WkV.png)\n\nIn order to enable the MaticX reserve to grow, the Supply Cap needs to be raised enabling more deposits into the reserve. Furthermore, Stader labs has indicated there are several large MaticX holders seeking to deposit into the MaticX reserve once the SupplyCap has been raised.\n\nWith reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/1) the preferred path forward is to implement several upgrades to gradually increase Aave's MaticX exposure over time. \n\nThis proposal will increase the Supply Cap from 8.6M units to  17.2M units.

We appreciate BGD's support throughout this proposal process.\n\nShould this AIP pass, we will implement the Avalanche market changes from a separate payload because AIPs currently do not support Avalanche changes. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkGJgnXk2.png)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.

      "description": "\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to to freeze DPI on the Aave V2 Ethereum market.\n\n# Motivation\n\nDPI is an index token redeemable for a basket of ERC-20s. Due to an extremely low market cap and trading volumes, combined with centralization considerations, we recommend freezing DPI on Aave V2.\nThrough 2021 DPI held a market cap between $100M and $200M with daily trading volumes in the $Ms. However, throughout 2022 the market cap has decreased drastically, staying between $10M-$30M for the past three months, with daily trading volume rarely crossing the $200K mark. On top of the low market cap and low trading volume, there is also implied centralization risk of DPI compared with the direct holding of the basket of underlying assets.\nThe respective governance forum discussion is linked below:\n\n- [[ARFC] - Add DPI to V3 Ethereum and Freeze on V2 Ethereum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-dpi-to-v3-ethereum-and-freeze-on-v2-ethereum/12354)\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: DPI\n\nContract Address: 0x1494CA1F11D487c2bBe4543E90080AeBa4BA3C2b\n\nThe proposal payload simply executes setReserveBorrowing(false) on the Aave V2 Ethereum LendingPoolConfigurator for DPI.\n\n# References\n\n[Forum Post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-dpi-to-v3-ethereum-and-freeze-on-v2-ethereum/12354)\n\n[Tests](https://github.com/ChaosLabsInc/aave-v2-payloads/blob/main/src/tests/AaveV2FreezeDPIPayloadTest.t.sol)\n\n[Proposal payload implementation](https://github.com/ChaosLabsInc/aave-v2-payloads/blob/main/src/payloads/AaveV2FreezeDPIPayload.sol)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

In this proposal, Chaos Labs recommends enabling all stablecoins listed on V3 Ethereum as borrowable in isolation mode 3.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe motivation to list the stablecoins as borrowable assets in Isolation Mode is similar to previous deployments and is derived mainly from the low volatility of those assets. Given that Isolation Mode assets are susceptible to high volatility, we find it paramount to maintain the other side of the position stable in order to reduce liquidations and resulting bad debt.\nThe respective governance forum discussion is linked below:\n\n- [[ARFC] - Configure Isolation Mode Borrowable Assets - V3 Ethereum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-configure-isolation-mode-borrowable-assets-v3-ethereum/12420/1)\n\n# Implementation\n\nWe recommend listing USDC, USDT, DAI, and LUSD as assets allowed for borrowing in Isolation Mode on Ethereum V3.\n\nThis proposal aims to implement a single AIP, which will simply call setBorrowableInIsolation() on the list of assets (USDC, DAI, USDT, LUSD) on the PoolConfigurator contract.\n\n# References\n\n- [Forum Post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-configure-isolation-mode-borrowable-assets-v3-ethereum/12420/1)\n- [Tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3ETHIsoMode_20230330/AaveV3ETHIsoMode_20230330_Test.t.sol)\n- [Proposal payload implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3ETHIsoMode_20230330/AaveV3ETHIsoMode_20230330.sol)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\nThis proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as part of FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum & Optimism liquidity pools.\n\n## Motivation\nDeFi Saver has a long-standing history of synergies with the Aave Protocol, being one of the first third-party integrations of Aave V1 in 2020.\n\nCurrently, every flashloan has a 9 bps fee that rewards liquidity providers in Aave. While flashloans were created by Aave, the ecosystem as a whole has replicated this feature, and most protocols do not implement any fees.\n\nThe ACI does not support waiving the fees for flashloans in general, as we firmly believe that users’ funds used, even in the context of a single transaction, should be rewarded.\n\nHowever, some strategic use cases of V3, such as emode, are very fee-sensitive as they mobilize high leverage. Waiving the DeFi Saver flashloan fees is expected to make these strategies more convenient and profitable, leading to increased borrow volume and thus increased Aave DAO revenue.\n\nThis proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as a part of FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum & Optimism liquidity pools.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis AIP aims to implement three similar payloads (one for each network), which will simply call addFlashBorrower() on the ACL_MANAGER contract.\n\nHere's one of these payloads for Ethereum:\n\n```solidity\n\ncontract AaveV3EthDFSFlashBorrowActivation is IProposalGenericExecutor {\n  address public constant FL_AAVE_V3 = 0xd9D8e68717Ce24CCbf162868aaad7E38d81b05d1;\n  address public constant FL_ACTION = 0x72915D41982DfCAf30b871290618E59C45Edba7F;\n\n  function execute() external {\n    AaveV3Ethereum.ACL_MANAGER.addFlashBorrower(FL_AAVE_V3);\n    AaveV3Ethereum.ACL_MANAGER.addFlashBorrower(FL_ACTION);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n\nA list of relevant links like for this proposal e.g.\n\n- [forum discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-defi-saver-to-flashborrowers-on-aave-v3/12410)\n- [tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-crosschain-listing-template/blob/main/src/AaveV3DFSFlashBorrow_20230403/AaveV3ETHDFSFlashBorrowActivation_20230403_test.t.sol)\n- [proposalCode](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-crosschain-listing-template/blob/main/src/AaveV3DFSFlashBorrow_20230403/AaveV3ETHDFSFlashBorrowActivation_20230403.sol)\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The debt ceiling is designed to restrict protocol exposure to price swings and potential resulting insolvencies.\n\nGauntlet's methodology for isolation mode is described [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-aave-v3-isolation-mode-methodology/12290).\n\n## Motivation\n\nSee the [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-aave-v3-isolation-mode-methodology/12290) for full details.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPer [Snapshot Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb1f8b1814d9c09760daa4d7e9fa90d906b2c9ff5fbd20c8d0f5793c4f5cc4999), the community has decided on the Aggressive option.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJPAJwvb3.png)\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal updates the debt ceiling of the listed assets using two pre-deployed payloads, which use the Aave Config Engine to update the debt ceilings:\n  - Arbitrum: [`0x4393277b02ef3ca293990a772b7160a8c76f2443`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x4393277b02ef3ca293990a772b7160a8c76f2443#code)\n  - Polygon: [`0x6bce15b789e537f3aba3c60cb183f0e8737f05ec`](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x6bce15b789e537f3aba3c60cb183f0e8737f05ec#code)\n\nPayload implementation and tests can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/120)\n\nAvalanche changes will be made via a Guardian Steward at a later date.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.

      "description": "\n\n# Summary\n\nLlama proposes increasing the wMATIC Supply Cap and BAL Borrow Cap on the Polygon v3 deployment after each respective proposal successfully passed a Snapshot vote. \n\n# Abstract\n\nThis publication presents Aave with the opportunity to increase the wMATIC SupplyCap from 47M to 66M units and the BAL Borrow Cap from 256,140 to 290,000 units on the Polygon v3 deployment. \n\nIncreasing the wMATIC Supply Cap will enable inflows from new Balancer bb-a-wMATIC liquidity pools and migration of user funds from v2 to v3 without exceeding the deposit restriction on v3. \n\nIncreasing the BAL Borrow Cap will enable Aave to benefit from elevated borrowing demand at a time when Tetu is offering considerable rewards.\n\nBoth risk service providers support increasing the BAL Borrowing Cap and wMATIC Supply Cap parameters.\n \n# Motivation\n\n## wMATIC Supply Cap\n\nWith Liquidity Mining (LM) ongoing on Polygon v3 by Polygon Foundation, Lido DAO and Stader Labs, the wMATIC v3 deposit rate comfortably exceeds the v2 deposits rate. This creates favourable conditions, encouraging users to migration wMATIC deposits. There is 14.94M units of wMATIC deposited in Aave v2 on Polgyon. \n\nThe MaticX/wMATIC and stMATIC/wMATIC Balancer Liquidity pools are migrating to MaticX/bb-a-wMATIC and stMATIC/bb-a-wMATIC. An estimated 23.03M units of wMATIC are expected to be deposited into the wMATIC reserve on Polygon v3.\n\nThe utilisation of the wMATIC reserve is 57% with 26.72M of 47.00M units deposited.  \n\nThe current SupplyCap is insufficient to accomodate the potential inflows of wMATIC into the reserve. As a result, this proposal seeks to increase the SupplyCap from 47M to 66M units. A Supply Cap of 66M enables the bb-a-wMATIC linear pools on Balancer to deposit into Aave and 100% of the v2 wMATIC deposits to migrate to v3. \n\n## BAL Borrow Cap\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CzJMapl.png)\n\nThe BAL Borrow Cap utilisation has been edging higher in recent weeks and previous Supply Cap adjustment proposals did not adjust the Borrow Cap. \n\nThis publication will increase the Borrow Cap modestly by an additional 13.2%, or 33.86k units, from 256,140 to 290,000 units. The Supply Cap is to remain unchanged as there is sufficient capacity in Aave v3 to enable migration of user funds from v2 to v3 on Polygon. Separately, an AIP has been submitted to add BAL to Aave v3 on Ethereum. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters are being presented by Llama:\n\nTicker: wMATIC\n\nContract: [`0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270`](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270)\n\n|Parameter|Current Value|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Supply Cap|47M units| 66M units|\n\nTicker: BAL\n\nToken Contract: [`0x9a71012B13CA4d3D0Cdc72A177DF3ef03b0E76A3`](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x9a71012b13ca4d3d0cdc72a177df3ef03b0e76a3)\n\n|Parameter|Current Value |Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Borrow Cap | 256,140 |290,000|\n\n# Implementation\n\nA list of relevant links like for this proposal:\n\n* [wMATIC Supply Cap Governance Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-wmatic-supply-cap-increase/12046)\n* [BAL Borrow Cap Governance Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-polygon-v3-bal-supply-borrow-cap-increase/12505/3)\n* [Test Cases](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3CapsUpdates_20230328/AaveV3PolCapsUpdates_20230328Test.t.sol)\n* [Payload Implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3CapsUpdates_20230328/AaveV3PolCapsUpdates_20230328.sol)\n* [Deployed Contracts](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x47938b58f104b4e06a5572faa9cb3c3cd53f15a4)\n\nChaos Labs and Gauntlet are both supportive of the risk parameters presented above. \n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Aave would benefit from being the first major lending market to list LDO. Users will be able to express various trading views on LDO’s price outlook in the lead up to Shanghai. \n \nThis publication uses the parameters provided by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs.\n\n# Motivation\n\nLido is a suite of software protocols that facilitates liquid staking across multiple blockchains. The Lido DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation. The LDO token is used to vote on the use of the DAO treasury associated with the protocols, research and development, and incentive programs.\n\nThe Lido DAO is an Aragon organization. The LDO token was created using an [Aragon Minime contract](https://aragon.org/dao). Since Aragon provides a full end-to-end framework to build DAOs, Lido DAO uses its standard tools.\n\nLDO is a Top 50 token by market cap, currently ranked [31st](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao) by Coingecko. Lido Protocol is the largest minter of liquid staked ETH tokens with [5,880,987 ETH staked](https://lido.fi/ethereum).\n\nMaking LDO available on Aave v3 would make Aave v3 the first major lending market to do so and would benefit from the first mover advantage.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe parameters shown below are the [combined recommendation](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-support-for-ldo-on-ethereum-v3/12045/5) of Gauntlet and Chaos Labs.\n\nTicker: LDO\n\nContract Address: [`0x5a98fcbea516cf06857215779fd812ca3bef1b32`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a98fcbea516cf06857215779fd812ca3bef1b32)\n\nOracle: LDO/ETH/USD: [`0xb01e6C9af83879B8e06a092f0DD94309c0D497E4`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb01e6C9af83879B8e06a092f0DD94309c0D497E4)\n\nOracle Components:\n\nLDO/ETH: [`0x4e844125952D32AcdF339BE976c98E22F6F318dB`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e844125952D32AcdF339BE976c98E22F6F318dB)\n\nETH/USD: [`0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419)\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|Yes|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap (LDO)|6,000,000|\n|Borrow Cap (LDO)|3,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|$7,500,000|\n|LTV|40.00%|\n|LT|50.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus| 9.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee |10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Stable Slope1|13.00%|\n|Stable Slope2|300%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n\n# Implementation\n\nTest cases can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3Listings_20230403/AaveV3Listings_20230403_PayloadTest.t.sol)\n\nPayload implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3Listings_20230403/AaveV3Listings_20230403_Payload.sol)\n\nDeployed Payload can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7b766a02eba6d8651eeebdeb886323fc64bf1739)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n",

      "description": "\n\n\n## Simple Summary\nTechnical upgrade to align the implementation and architecture of Aave’s ecosystem Collector contracts across all networks.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Aave ecosystem, and more precisely its liquidity protocol (v1/v2/v3) collect fees in a decentralized way, which later on are used for example to fund grants, pay different service providers, or pursue different other strategies.\n\nAll these actions are controlled by the Aave Governance V2 smart contracts (or cross-chain governance), and due to technical reasons regarding upgradeable contracts, usually they are triggered by interacting with another contract called Controller of Collector, which simply acts as a layer of indirection with the Collector itself.\n\nBut in practice, this current organization has some points of improvement:\n\n- The codebase of the Collector is different across instances of Aave. The most updated version is the one on Ethereum, with others for example not supporting streaming, just because of legacy reasons.\n- The pattern of Controller of Collector <> Collector can be simplified and unified with other parts of the ecosystem.\n\nSometimes, this lack of technical unification creates overhead (both operational and of understanding) on contributors, specifically those interacting with the “treasury” side of the protocol like Llama, so we present this proposal to improve the system.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe smart contract used as the implementation of the Aave v2 & v3 Collector (a common proxy for both) is the most updated of the ecosystem, activated on https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/71/, and mainly adding streaming capabilities.\n\n- UpgradeAaveCollectorPayload: this proposal payload will deploy the most up-to-date version of the collector and set it as the implementation for the existing proxy for all v3 deployments. Moreover, it will change not optimal \"Controller of Collector\" pattern to a more commonly used \"ProxyAdmin\".\n\nCurrently, apart from Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche are the only networks with both instances of Aave v2 and v3.\n\n- MigrateV2CollectorPayload: This proposal will redirect all future fee collection of the v2 pools to v3’s Collector by updating the AToken implementation. For both Polygon and Avalanche v2, instances, before redirecting fee collection to the v3’s Collector, the proposal will send there all the accrued fees plus rewards incentives on those.\n\nThis proposal will be an approval for the Avalanche part, and both payloads will be executed there separately by the Aave Guardian. For other networks, the execution will happen through this proposal.\n\n## References\n\nA list of relevant links like for this proposal:\n\n- [forum discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v2-v3-collectors-unification/12434)\n- [tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-collector-unification/tree/main/tests) \n- Contracts:\n  - [Collector](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-collector-unification/blob/main/src/contracts/Collector.sol)\n  - [AaveMigrationCollector](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-collector-unification/blob/main/src/contracts/payloads/AaveMigrationCollector.sol) \n  - [AToken](https://github.com/bgd-labs/protocol-v2/blob/update-atoken-revision/contracts/protocol/tokenization/AToken.sol)\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nThe previous upgrade of the Collector contract, which is currently active on Mainnet, was [reviewed by Certora](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-ecosystem-reserve-v2/tree/release/final-proposal/certora). Our policy was to have minimum deviaton from this version.\n\n- **Code diffing**: Comparing the codebase of all existing Collectors with the consolidated one, to not have any unexpected logic included or missing.\n\n- **Storage diffing**: Comparing the storage layout of versions, to verify that there is no misalignment between them, which could create important problems.

This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range.\n\nPlease find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).\n\nYou can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).\n\nThe output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC and DAI on V3 Optimism, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with no effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)\n\nSimulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$155,000, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameter proposal is presented below:\n\n| Asset | Parameter             | Current | Recommended | Change |\n| ----- | --------------------- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |\n| WBTC  | Liquidation Threshold | 75%     | 78%         | +3%    |\n| WBTC  | Loan-to-Value         | 70%     | 73%         | +3%    |\n| WBTC  | Liquidation Penalty   | 9.4%    | 8.5%        | -0.9%  |\n| DAI   | Liquidation Threshold | 80%     | 83%         | +3%    |\n| DAI   | Loan-to-Value         | 75%     | 78%         | +3%    |\n\n# References\n\n[Forum Post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-aave-v3-optimism-2023-03-22/12421)\n\n[Tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3OPRiskParams_20230330/AaveV3OPRiskParams_20230330_Test.t.sol)\n\n[Proposal payload implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3OPRiskParams_20230330/AaveV3OPRiskParams_20230330.sol)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal upgrades the Aave v3 instances on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism and Arbitrum to the v3.0.2 version.\nThe v3.0.2 is an upgrade based on the v3.0.1 version already running on the new Aave v3 Ethereum pool which comes with improvements to the handling of isolation mode, LTV0, and flashBorrower initiated flashloans.\nIf this proposal succeeds, it will also authorize the upgrade of the V3 pools on Avalanche and Fantom via a delegatecall by the Aave Guardian.\n\nThe upgrades to be performed will affect the following contracts:\n\n1. Pool\n2. PoolConfigurator\n3. aToken/variableDebtToken/stableDebtToken\n\nAnd replace the `AaveProtocolDataProvider` on the PoolAddressesProvider with it's next iteration.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave v3 Ethereum has been activated via Aave governance at the end of January. But in reality, as described [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-ethereum-new-deployment-vs-aave-v2-upgrade/9990/13), the smart contracts on Ethereum are a slightly improved version of v3, the so-called v3.0.1.\n\nIn an ecosystem like Aave, with liquidity pool instances spread across multiple networks, it is fundamental to try to keep version consistency, which is not the case at moment, with Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Arbitrum, Fantom, and Harmony running still on v3.0.0. Therefore this proposal aligns all pools at v3.0.2.\n\n## Specification\n\nUpon execution on the respective network the proposal will:\n\n- call `POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.setPoolImpl(NEW_POOL_IMPL)` to replace the Pool implementation (all networks)\n- call `POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.setPoolConfiguratorImpl(NEW_POOL_CONFIGURATOR_IMPL)` to replace the PoolConfigurator implementation (all networks, excluding mainnet)\n- call `POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.setPoolDataProvider(NEW_PROTOCOL_DATA_PROVIDER)` to replace the AaveProtocolDataProvider (all networks, excluding mainnet)\n- iterate through all currently listed tokens on the pool (fetched via `POOL.getReservesList()`) (all networks, excluding mainnet)\n  - call `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.updateAToken(inputAToken)` to replace the aToken implementation\n  - call `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.updateVariableDebtToken(inputVToken)` to replace the vToken implementation\n  - call `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.updateStableDebtToken(inputSToken)` to replace the sToken implementation\n  - call `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.setReserveFlashLoaning(reserve, true)` to enable flashloaning on the reserve\n- call `ACL_MANAGER.grantRole(ISOLATED_COLLATERAL_SUPPLIER_ROLE, SWAP_COLLATERAL_ADAPTER)` to maintain pre-upgrade behavior (all networks, excluding harmony)\n- call `ACL_MANAGER.grantRole(ISOLATED_COLLATERAL_SUPPLIER_ROLE, MIGRATION_HELPER)` to maintain pre-upgrade behavior (mainnet, avalanche, polygon)\n\n## Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n- **Code diffing**: Comparing the codebase of all v3.0.0 with the one of v3.0.1, more specifically the one on Aave v3 Ethereum, to not have any unexpected logic included.\n- **Storage diffing**: Comparing the storage layout of both versions, to verify that there is no misalignment between them, which could create important problems.\n- **Assets configurations pre/post upgrade**: In a simulation environment, validating the configurations of the assets pre-upgrade are the same as post-upgrade, only with those changes that are intended (e.g. enabling the new `flashloanable` flag only present on v3.0.1, later explained).\n- **Additional E2E tests**: Also in a simulation environment, checking that the main actions available on the pool can be performed (e.g. supply, borrow) on all pools with non-frozen assets.\n- **Extra review**: Given their involvement in the development of Aave v3, we have requested AaveCompanies to take a look at the procedure, in order to have multiple parties validating it.\n- **Audit**: Certora and SigmaPrime reviewed the v3.0.1 -> v3.0.2 changes\n\nThe decision to enable `flashloanable` for all the assets has been taken in order to have the highest possible consistency with the current state of the assets in the pools: currently, all are flashloanable, so by enabling the new flag, they will continue to be so.\n\n## References\n\n-

      "description": "\n\n# Summary\n\nThis AIP presents the community with the opportunity to add wstETH to the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nAcross the Aave v3 Liquidity Pools, wstETH is listed on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism. This proposal seeks to list wstETH on the Polygon Liquidity Pool as Collateral, with Borrowing enabled and an Ethereum correlated eMode. wETH will also be added to this Ethereum correlated eMode. The parameters are listed below.\n\nThe stETH/wETH rewards-maximising loop on Aave v2 Ethereum is the main source of borrowing demand for wETH. The wETH reserve generates a material portion of Aave’s revenue, more than [$294k](https://dune.com/llama/Aave-ETH-Market-Parameters-Simulation) during March 2023. \n\nBy listing wstETH on Polygon users will be able to enter the same yield maximising strategy creating borrowing demand for wETH and revenue for Aave.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe stETH reserve on Aave v2 is the largest reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.90B in deposits, exceeding USDC ($0.62B) and ETH ($1.41B). This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximising strategy. \n\nDemand for borrowing wETH on Aave v2 Ethereum increased significantly when stETH was listed as collateral. InstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO, CIAN and others have all built products on top of Aave v2 that utilise the rewards-maximising stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Polygon Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Polygon. This is expected to create borrowing demand for wETH and boost Aave’s revenue.\n\nThe charts below show the effect of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum liquidity pool. stETH drives most of the wETH borrowing demand and resulting wETH fee-revenue. The wETH reserve generated approximately $244k and $294k during Fabruary and March respectively.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RaduU68.png)\n\nListing of stETH by Aave has enabled Aave to offer the best return on wETH, in wETH terms, across major lending markets, continually outperforming Compound. By listing wstETH on Polygon, the Aave community is helping create an environment capable of replicating the success of the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis section presents the risk parameters and interest rates parameters presented by [Gauntlet and Chaos Labs](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-wsteth-on-polygon-v3/12266/4) on the governance forum.\n\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled| Yes|\n|Supply Cap (wstETH)| 1,800|\n|Borrow Cap (wstETH)| 285|\n|Debt Ceiling| 0|\n|LTV| 70.00%|\n|LT| 79.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus| 7.20%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee |10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.25%|\n|Variable Slope1|4.50%|\n|Variable Slope2|80.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|4.50%|\n|Stable Slope2|80.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|1.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|8.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|\n\neMode category: ETH Correlated Strategy\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n| LT | 93% |\n| LTV | 90% |\n| LB | 1% |\n\n# Implementation\n\nA list of relevant links like for this proposal:\n\n  * [Test Cases](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/tree/main/src/AaveV3Listings_20230413/AaveV3Listings_20230413_PayloadTest.t.sol)\n  * [Payload Implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/tree/main/src/AaveV3Listings_20230413/AaveV3Listings_20230413_Payload.sol)\n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\nAave [governance forum discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-wsteth-on-polygon-v3/12266)and [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x9d7296b06a66d6d6b4c9e85051477a4d62d066e3f56c248bcc85cbea00f7c7a4).\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

This was performed with the intention of monitoring the market response and revising the rates higher at a later date.\n\nThis publication presents the next BAL interest rate increase.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAt the time of writing the utilisation and borrowing rate for BAL on the Polygon v3 deployment is nearing the Uoptimal value, 80%. With utilisation at 77.34% and the borrow APY 17.98%, the market is signalling strong demand for borrowing BAL.\n\n![|602x264](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/19l1mSPDDfwqZjucfpmkcoaRWQICKqoCFCrlKM8dNf0ZCb6DQUgdyLKhYXtkJ4GdDrg1e3zEQ4-Mg5LB8QfyM9QRLpbWKOutsBAiGG-gFXnkbZz28U49aCuGLp0hk078r0LsJ8nMJONNfYPbpIQwotA)\n\nThe table below presents the current APY for various tokenised B-80BAL-20WETH wrappers deposited into their respective liquidity pools:\n\n||Description|APY|TVL|Network|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Aura Finance (Aura Gauge)|B-80BAL-20WETH / auraBAL|58.21%|$21,380,000|Ethereum|\n|Tetu (Balancer Gauge)|B-80BAL-20WETH / tetuBAL|88.77%|$10,220,000|Polygon|\n|Stake DAO (Balancer Gauge)|B-80BAL-20WETH / sdBAL|18.25% - 45.35%|$637,221|Ethereum|\n\nThe APY for each of the pools above exceeds the Uoptimal borrow rate APR, Base + Slope1, 17% APR or 18.53% APY, compounded interest rate over time. Previous commentary from Gauntlet supported a Base + Slope1 total of 40% at the time Aura Finance was offering around 60%. Tetu is deployed on Polygon and is currently offering a notably higher 88.77% yield for depositing and locking the B-80BAL-20WETH / tetuBAL.\n\nPrevious discussion within the community centred around increasing the borrowing rates gradually over time and monitoring the market's response. \n\nThe previous proposal increased the Borrow rate at the Uoptimal point from 7% to 17%. This publication seeks to increase the borrow rate by a similar 10%. This is to be achieved by increasing the Base from 3% to 5% and Slope1 from 14% to 22%. Pending how the market responds, this interest rate can be further increased. This approach keeps true to the previous communication of gradually increasing the borrow rates rather than all at once.\n\n![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NP5xMf8IuxxR5xVN525978OIUofs1twCOJgYQPCrkuQtoJq7oYx2Lh4SrU7I1nDYVfB5EM2wt9tQMig4pfCM8AnSSbwpWTw9IjrfcaWanBwc9Rya84lH2sSa-dlxlxHC-4jgi1PJ4Ya_Tlj5EXCCxTg \"Chart\")\n\n# Specification\n\nUpdate the following parameters as per below table:\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|80.00|80.00|\n|Base|3.00|5.00|\n|Slope1|14.00|22.00|\n|Slope2|150.00|150.00|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|0.00|22.00|\n|Stable Slope2|0.00|150.00|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|2.00|5.00|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|5.00|5.00|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00|20.00|\n\nThis is to be implemented across all BAL reserves, Polygon v2, v3, Ethereum v2 and v3.\n\n# Implementation\n\nPayload for AAVE V3 Ethereum can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3RatesUpdates_20230328/AaveV3EthRatesUpdates_20230328.sol)\n\nTests can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3RatesUpdates_20230328/AaveV3MultiRatesUpdates_20230328Test.t.sol)\n\nPayload for AAVE V3 Polygon can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3RatesUpdates_20230328/AaveV3PolRatesUpdates_20230328.sol)\n\nTests can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3RatesUpdates_20230328/AaveV3MultiRatesUpdates_20230328Test.t.sol)\n\nDeployment script for interest rate strategy can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-interest-rate-strategy-deployer/blob/main/script/DeployContract.s.sol)\n\nPayload for AAVE V2 Polygon can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3RatesUpdates_20230328/AaveV2PolRatesUpdates_20230328_Payload.sol)\n\nPayload for AAVE V2 Ethereum can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3RatesUpdates_20230328/AaveV2EthRatesUpdates_20230328_Payload.sol)\n\nTests can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3RatesUpdates_20230328/AaveV2MultiRatesUpdates_20230328_PayloadTest.t.sol)\n\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Each Steward will handle the listing of one specific asset and then renounce to the granted `POOL_ADMIN` role. This process is needed as otherwise, the proposal's gas limit would be really high.\n\nThe pool activation will be done via the cross-chain governance with the help of cross-chain forwarder on Ethereum, which on a successful vote by the community, will trigger queuing of the payload action on Metis, which later could be executed by anyone.\n\n## Configuration snapshot\n\nWhat you can see here is a formatted excerpt of the configuration snapshot with the relevant configurations after proposal execution. Although stable borrowing is disabled for all the respective assets, interest rate parameters for stable borrowing have been configured according to the values set in [Aave V3 Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-ethereum-proposal/blob/main/src/contracts/AaveV3EthereumRateStrategiesDefinition.sol).

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal upgrades the Aave v3 instances on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism and Arbitrum to the v3.0.2 version.\nThe v3.0.2 is an upgrade based on the v3.0.1 version already running on the new Aave v3 Ethereum pool which comes with improvements to the handling of isolation mode, LTV0, and flashBorrower initiated flashloans.\nIf this proposal succeeds, it will also authorize the upgrade of the V3 pools on Avalanche and Fantom via a delegatecall by the Aave Guardian.\n\nThe upgrades to be performed will affect the following contracts:\n\n1. Pool\n2. PoolConfigurator\n3. aToken/variableDebtToken/stableDebtToken\n\nAnd replace the `AaveProtocolDataProvider` on the PoolAddressesProvider with it's next iteration.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave v3 Ethereum has been activated via Aave governance at the end of January. But in reality, as described [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-ethereum-new-deployment-vs-aave-v2-upgrade/9990/13), the smart contracts on Ethereum are a slightly improved version of v3, the so-called v3.0.1.\n\nIn an ecosystem like Aave, with liquidity pool instances spread across multiple networks, it is fundamental to try to keep version consistency, which is not the case at moment, with Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Arbitrum, Fantom, and Harmony running still on v3.0.0. Therefore this proposal aligns all pools at v3.0.2.\n\n## Specification\n\nUpon execution on the respective network the proposal will:\n\n- call `POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.setPoolImpl(NEW_POOL_IMPL)` to replace the Pool implementation (all networks)\n- call `POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.setPoolConfiguratorImpl(NEW_POOL_CONFIGURATOR_IMPL)` to replace the PoolConfigurator implementation (all networks, excluding mainnet)\n- call `POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.setPoolDataProvider(NEW_PROTOCOL_DATA_PROVIDER)` to replace the AaveProtocolDataProvider (all networks, excluding mainnet)\n- iterate through all currently listed tokens on the pool (fetched via `POOL.getReservesList()`) (all networks, excluding mainnet)\n  - call `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.updateAToken(inputAToken)` to replace the aToken implementation\n  - call `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.updateVariableDebtToken(inputVToken)` to replace the vToken implementation\n  - call `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.updateStableDebtToken(inputSToken)` to replace the sToken implementation\n  - call `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.setReserveFlashLoaning(reserve, true)` to enable flashloaning on the reserve\n- call `ACL_MANAGER.grantRole(ISOLATED_COLLATERAL_SUPPLIER_ROLE, SWAP_COLLATERAL_ADAPTER)` to maintain pre-upgrade behavior (all networks, excluding harmony)\n- call `ACL_MANAGER.grantRole(ISOLATED_COLLATERAL_SUPPLIER_ROLE, MIGRATION_HELPER)` to maintain pre-upgrade behavior (mainnet, avalanche, polygon)\n- call `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.updateFlashloanPremiumTotal(0.0005e4)` and `updateFlashloanPremiumToProtocol(0.0004e4)` to align flash loan fees with the currently configured.\n\n## Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n- **Code diffing**: Comparing the codebase of all v3.0.0 with the one of v3.0.1, more specifically the one on Aave v3 Ethereum, to not have any unexpected logic included.\n- **Storage diffing**: Comparing the storage layout of both versions, to verify that there is no misalignment between them, which could create important problems.\n- **Assets configurations pre/post upgrade**: In a simulation environment, validating the configurations of the assets pre-upgrade are the same as post-upgrade, only with those changes that are intended (e.g. enabling the new `flashloanable` flag only present on v3.0.1, later explained).\n- **Additional E2E tests**: Also in a simulation environment, checking that the main actions available on the pool can be performed (e.g. supply, borrow) on all pools with non-frozen assets.\n- **Extra review**: Given their involvement in the development of Aave v3, we have requested AaveCompanies to take a look at the procedure, in order to have multiple parties validating it.\n- **Audit**: Certora and SigmaPrime reviewed the v3.0.1 -> v3.0.2 changes\n\nThe decision to enable `flashloanable` for all the assets has been taken in order to have the highest possible consistency with the current state of the assets in the pools: currently, all are flashloanable, so by enabling the new flag, they will continue to be so.\n\n## References\n\n- [Repository](https://github.com/bgd-labs/proposal-3.0.1-upgrade)\n-

      "description": "\n\n# Summary\n\nThis AIP presents the community with the opportunity to upgrade the safety module to v1.5 which introduces:\n\n- a new slashing mechanism\n- new cooldown mechanism\n- a transfer hook to be used by GHO\n\nThe new version also adds some convenience features like permit support or the ability to claim and stake in a single transaction.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOn September 2020, the Aave Safety Module was introduced into the ecosystem, to improve the protection of the liquidity protocol, adding an extra utility for the AAVE token: AAVE or AAVE/WETH BPT holders stake their assets to act as a defensive layer in front of any shortfall event.\n\nSince then, apart from really minor upgrades, the contracts have remained the same and in parallel, the system has been adopted by other communities.\n\nAs part of our engagement with Aave, we identified that the Safety Module is a clear area of improvement in the ecosystem, from 2 different standpoints:\n\n- Technical. Improving the basic existing mechanisms of the contracts, but without disrupting radically the current design of the SM.\n- Conceptual. Making more efficient the SM dynamics (e.g. slashing, rewards distribution rules, etc), by modifying the whole design.\n\n## New slashing mechanism\n\nOn the running SM v1, in order to slash, an ad-hoc governance proposal is required, involving important development overhead, which is not ideal.\n\nThe new SM v1.5 adds an enhanced mechanism to facilitate slashing of the underlying by tracking an exchange rate between the staked AAVE and the stkAAVE received by stakers. The mechanism is simple: when somebody stakes AAVE, they receive a certain amount of stkAAVE, which no longer is 1:1 equivalent, as it keeps track of slashing (meaning with the same stkAAVE, stakers are able to claim less AAVE).\n\n## New cooldown mechanism\n\nThe current cooldown on SM v1 consists of a time delay of 10 days to be respected whenever anybody wants to redeem the staked AAVE. At the moment, this cooldown is affected by in/outflows of stkAAVE, both via transfer() and stake()/redeem(), in order to protect the system from being gamed. Even with this protection mechanism the mechanism is currently gamable, by staking aave within the active cooldown window to [extend the window](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/issues/6).\n\nThis mechanism is not really optimal and adds important complexity, so on v1.5 has been changed to the following: after activation of cooldown, a staker will be able to redeem the minimum balance he will hold between cooldown activation and redeem window. Apart from the user-level cooldown new mechanics, we also propose to increase the cooldown period from 10 days to 20 days.\n\n## GHO Transfer hook\n\nThe Aave community has already approved the deployment and activation of the GHO stablecoin and the first facilitator will be the Aave v3 Ethereum pool.\n\nIn order to enable the discount mechanism by holding stkAAVE described on the GHO proposal, the design of Aave Companies requires to introduce of a piece of logic on the stkAAVE transfer(), in order to “notify” the GHO facilitator system of stakers’ balances.\n\nWe have evaluated this and we think it is acceptable, so it will be included in this upgrade. From a technical perspective, stkAAVE includes logic protections to remain unaffected if anything would go wrong with the GHO facilitator, which at the same time should be considered a trustable entity, as it will be controlled by the Aave governance.\n\n## Misc\n\nThe upgrade also allowed us to add some smaller ux improvements:\n\n- a new `stakeWithPermit()` is introduced on `stkAAVE`\n\n- convenience methods to batch claiming and staking/redeeming into a single transaction have been added as `claimRewardsAndRedeem` and `claimRewardsAndStake` have been added to `stkAAVE`\n\n- `preview*()` methods have been added to follow the `4626` standard more closely, even if there's no objective to be compliant\n\n# Specification PART 1\n\nThe proposal is split in two parts, as currently the `stkAAVE` is controlled by the `LONG_EXECUTOR` where `stkABPT` is controlled by the `SHORT_EXECUTOR`. As there's a single executor per proposal `Part 1` upgrades the `stkAAVE` implementation and targets the `LONG_EXECUTOR`. `Part 2` upgrades the `stkABPT` implementation and targets the `SHORT_EXECUTOR`.\n\nThe proposal will:\n\n- transfer ownership of `stkAAVE` to a `ProxyAdmin` controlled by the `LONG_EXECUTOR`. This is done for consistency reasons with `stkABPT` as the `SHORT_EXECUTOR` cannot be the `SLASHING_ADMIN` and `PROXY_ADMIN` at the same time.\n\n```solidity\nIInitializableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy(STK_AAVE).changeAdmin(\n  address(AaveMisc.PROXY_ADMIN_ETHEREUM_LONG)\n);\n```\n\n- deploy the new implementation while maintaining the current values:\n\n```solidity\nStakedAaveV3 newImpl = new StakedAaveV3(\n  IERC20(AaveV2EthereumAssets.AAVE_UNDERLYING),\n  IERC20(AaveV2EthereumAssets.AAVE_UNDERLYING),\n  GenericProposal.UNSTAKE_WINDOW,\n  GenericProposal.REWARDS_VAULT,\n  GenericProposal.EMISSION_MANAGER,\n  GenericProposal.DISTRIBUTION_DURATION\n);\n```\n\n- upgrade `stkAAVE` implementation. The `SLASHING_ADMIN`, `COOLDOWN_ADMIN` and `CLAIM_HELPER` are all initialized as the `SHORT_EXECUTOR`. `MAX_SLASHING` is set to `30%`, `COOLDOWN_SECONDS` is increased to `20 days`:\n\n```solidity\nProxyAdmin(AaveMisc.PROXY_ADMIN_ETHEREUM_LONG).upgradeAndCall(\n  TransparentUpgradeableProxy(payable(STK_AAVE)),\n  address(newImpl),\n  abi.encodeWithSignature(\n    'initialize(address,address,address,uint256,uint256)',\n    GenericProposal.SLASHING_ADMIN,\n    GenericProposal.COOLDOWN_ADMIN,\n    GenericProposal.CLAIM_HELPER,\n    GenericProposal.MAX_SLASHING,\n    GenericProposal.COOLDOWN_SECONDS\n  )\n);\n```\n\n# References\n\nA list of relevant links like for this proposal:\n\n- [ProposalPayloads](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/blob/main/src/contracts/ProposalPayload.sol)\n- [StakedTokenV3](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/blob/main/src/contracts/StakedTokenV3.sol)\n- [StakedAaveV3](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/blob/main/src/contracts/StakedAaveV3.sol)\n- [sigma prime audit](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/blob/main/audits/Sigma_Prime_Aave_Safety_Module_Security_Assessment_Report_v2.pdf)\n- [Certora audit](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/blob/main/audits/Certora_FV_Report.pdf)\n- [Certora specs](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/tree/main/certora/specs)\n- [Test Cases](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/tree/main/tests)\n- [Technical review by aave companies](https://governance.aave.com/t/technical-review-aave-safety-module-v1-5/12436)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across four (4) Aave V3 Polygon assets.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal acts as a mandate from the Aave community to engage with Chaos for the work defined on the Aave governance forum [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025) and pre-approved by the Aave community via Snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xad105e87d4df487bbe1daec2cd94ca49d1ea595901f5773c1804107539288b59).\n\n## Motivation\n\nChaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt.\n\n*Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range.*\n\nPlease find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).\n\nYou can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).\n\nThe output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC, DAI, LINK and wMATIC on V3 Polygon, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with no effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)\n\nSimulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~400,000$, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recommended | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 78% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Loan-to-Value | 70% | 73% | +3% |\n| DAI | Liquidation Threshold | 80% | 81% | +1% |\n| DAI | Loan-to-Value | 75% | 76% | +1% |\n| LINK | Liquidation Threshold | 65% | 68% | +3% |\n| LINK | Loan-to-Value | 50% | 53% | +3% |\n| wMATIC | Liquidation Threshold | 70% | 73% | +3% |\n| wMATIC | Loan-to-Value | 65% | 68% | +3% |\n| wMATIC | Liquidation Penalty | 10% | 7% | -3% |\n\n# References\n\n[Forum Post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-aave-v3-polygon-2023-04-23/12828)\n\n[Test](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3PolRiskParams_20230423/AaveV3PolRiskParams_20230423_Test.t.sol)\n\n[Proposal payload implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3PolRiskParams_20230423/AaveV3PolRiskParams_20230423.sol)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes increasing the MaticX Supply Cap on Polygon v3 from 17.2M units to 29.3M units. It also corrects the Aave Grants DAO aUSDT allowance that was incorrectly set previously.\n\n# Abstract\n\nAfter a vote for increasing the communities counter party risk was passed on Snapshot, the Supply Cap for MaticX can be increased from 50% to 75% of circulating supply.\n\nThe dominant use case for MaticX on Aave Protocol is as collateral to borrow wMATIC. Since the MaticX oracle, a calculated price feed provided by Chainlink based upon the underlying asset's (MATIC) price, the risk of liquidation is minimal. As a result, the primary risk of increasing aave Protocol's exposure to MaticX is the assocaited counterparty risk which is expressed as concentration risk with up to 75% of supply on the Polygon network.\n\nThe current Supply Cap's utilisation is hovering around 94%, with 1.03M units of MaticX deposit capacity. Stader Labs is currently offering SD rewards to user who deposit MaticX. This proposal seeks to encourage Stader Labs to continue distributing SD rewards by increasing the Supply Cap and enabling more MaticX to be deposited into Aave. \n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions conducive to growing TVL and Revenue by facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. \n\nWith liquidity mining ongoing, MaticX deposit rewards (SD) and wMATIC borrowing rewards (stMATIC & MaticX), ensuring there is adequate capacity enabling the yield maximising strategies to grow is key for Aave Protcol's abililty to generate wMATIC revenue. Several liquidity pools on Balancer v2 now include bb-a-wMATIC with over 14.5M units of wMATIC being deposited in Aave Protocol. This has lead to reduced borrowing rates for wMATIC and supports the continued growth of yield maximising strategies on Aave Protocol. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CdVGNQ9.png)\n\nTo facilitate the continued growth of the MaticX reserve, the Supply Cap needs to be raised enabling more deposits into the reserve.\n\nWith reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/1) the preferred path forward is to implement several upgrades to gradually increase Aave's MaticX exposure over time. \n\nThis proposal will increase the Supply Cap from 17.2M units to  29.3M units.

      "description": "\n\n# Summary\n\nThis AIP presents the community with the opportunity to upgrade the safety module to v1.5 which introduces:\n\n- a new slashing mechanism\n- new cooldown mechanism\n\nThe new version also adds some convenience features like permit support or the ability to claim and stake in a single transaction.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOn September 2020, the Aave Safety Module was introduced into the ecosystem, to improve the protection of the liquidity protocol, adding an extra utility for the AAVE token: AAVE or AAVE/WETH BPT holders stake their assets to act as a defensive layer in front of any shortfall event.\n\nSince then, apart from really minor upgrades, the contracts have remained the same and in parallel, the system has been adopted by other communities.\n\nAs part of our engagement with Aave, we identified that the Safety Module is a clear area of improvement in the ecosystem, from 2 different standpoints:\n\n- Technical. Improving the basic existing mechanisms of the contracts, but without disrupting radically the current design of the SM.\n- Conceptual. Making more efficient the SM dynamics (e.g. slashing, rewards distribution rules, etc), by modifying the whole design.\n\n## New slashing mechanism\n\nOn the running SM v1, in order to slash, an ad-hoc governance proposal is required, involving important development overhead, which is not ideal.\n\nThe new SM v1.5 adds an enhanced mechanism to facilitate slashing of the underlying by tracking an exchange rate between the staked AAVE and the stkAAVE received by stakers. The mechanism is simple: when somebody stakes AAVE, they receive a certain amount of stkAAVE, which no longer is 1:1 equivalent, as it keeps track of slashing (meaning with the same stkAAVE, stakers are able to claim less AAVE).\n\n## New cooldown mechanism\n\nThe current cooldown on SM v1 consists of a time delay of 10 days to be respected whenever anybody wants to redeem the staked AAVE. At the moment, this cooldown is affected by in/outflows of stkAAVE, both via transfer() and stake()/redeem(), in order to protect the system from being gamed. Even with this protection mechanism the mechanism is currently gamable, by staking aave within the active cooldown window to [extend the window](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/issues/6).\n\nThis mechanism is not really optimal and adds important complexity, so on v1.5 has been changed to the following: after activation of cooldown, a staker will be able to redeem the minimum balance he will hold between cooldown activation and redeem window. Apart from the user-level cooldown new mechanics, we also propose to increase the cooldown period from 10 days to 20 days.\n\n## Misc\n\nThe upgrade also allowed us to add some smaller ux improvements:\n\n- `preview*()` methods have been added to follow the `4626` standard more closely, even if there's no objective to be compliant\n\n# Specification PART 2\n\nThe proposal is split in two parts, as currently the `stkAAVE` is controlled by the `LONG_EXECUTOR` where `stkABPT` is controlled by the `SHORT_EXECUTOR`. As there's a single executor per proposal `Part 1` upgrades the `stkAAVE` implementation and targets the `LONG_EXECUTOR`. `Part 2` upgrades the `stkABPT` implementation and targets the `SHORT_EXECUTOR`.\n\nThe proposal will:\n\n- transfer ownership of `stkABPT` to a `ProxyAdmin` controlled by the `SHORT_EXECUTOR`.\n\n```solidity\nIInitializableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy(STK_ABPT).changeAdmin(\n  address(AaveMisc.PROXY_ADMIN_ETHEREUM)\n);\n```\n\n- deploy the new implementation while maintaining the current values:\n\n```solidity\nStakedAaveV3 newImpl =new StakedTokenV3(\n  IERC20(ABPT),\n  IERC20(AaveV2EthereumAssets.AAVE_UNDERLYING),\n  GenericProposal.UNSTAKE_WINDOW,\n  GenericProposal.REWARDS_VAULT,\n  GenericProposal.EMISSION_MANAGER,\n  GenericProposal.DISTRIBUTION_DURATION\n);\n```\n\n- upgrade `stkABPT` implementation. The `SLASHING_ADMIN`, `COOLDOWN_ADMIN` and `CLAIM_HELPER` are all initialized as the `SHORT_EXECUTOR`. `MAX_SLASHING` is set to `30%`, `COOLDOWN_SECONDS` is increased to `20 days`:\n\n```solidity\nProxyAdmin(AaveMisc.PROXY_ADMIN_ETHEREUM).upgradeAndCall(\n  TransparentUpgradeableProxy(payable(STK_ABPT)),\n  address(newImpl),\n  abi.encodeWithSignature(\n  'initialize(address,address,address,uint256,uint256)',\n  GenericProposal.SLASHING_ADMIN,\n  GenericProposal.COOLDOWN_ADMIN,\n  GenericProposal.CLAIM_HELPER,\n  GenericProposal.MAX_SLASHING,\n  GenericProposal.COOLDOWN_SECONDS\n  )\n);\n```\n\n# References\n\nA list of relevant links like for this proposal:\n\n- [ProposalPayloads](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/blob/main/src/contracts/ProposalPayload.sol)\n- [StakedTokenV3](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/blob/main/src/contracts/StakedTokenV3.sol)\n- [StakedAaveV3](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/blob/main/src/contracts/StakedAaveV3.sol)\n- [sigma prime audit](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/blob/main/audits/Sigma_Prime_Aave_Safety_Module_Security_Assessment_Report_v2.pdf)\n- [Certora audit](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/blob/main/audits/Certora_FV_Report.pdf)\n- [Certora specs](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/tree/main/certora/specs)\n- [Test Cases](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-v1-5/tree/main/tests)\n- [Technical review by aave companies](https://governance.aave.com/t/technical-review-aave-safety-module-v1-5/12436)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Last November, we proposed interest rate curve changes for the Aave V2 Ethereum market using our interest rate curve optimization framework. Our methodology makes data-informed decisions around setting borrower and supplier interest rates when market conditions require the protocol to reduce risk or when strategic opportunities present themselves to increase protocol revenue without materially impacting risk. This analysis further finetunes the interest rate curves of Aave V2 Ethereum, and extends our methodology to Polygon and Avalanche.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAave V2 Ethereum\n\n|                  | FRAX           | GUSD          | USDP           | USDT           | WBTC            |\n|:-----------------|:---------------|:--------------|:---------------|:---------------|:----------------|\n| Optimal          | 0.8            | **0.8 → 0.7** | **0.9 → 0.8**  | 0.8            | 0.65            |\n| Variable Base    | 0.0            | 0.0           | 0.0            | 0.0            | 0.0             |\n| Variable Slope 1 | 0.04           | 0.04          | 0.04           | 0.04           | **0.08 → 0.04** |\n| Variable Slope 2 | **0.75 → 1.0** | **1.0 → 1.5** | **0.6 → 0.75** | **0.75 → 1.0** | 3.0             |\n| Stable Base      | 0.0            | 0.04          | 0.0            | 0.1            | 0.03            |\n| Stable Slope 1   | 0.0            | 0.04          | 0.0            | 0.02           | 0.1             |\n| Stable Slope 2   | 0.0            | 1.0           | 0.0            | **0.75 → 1.0** | 3.0             |\n| Reserve Factor   | 0.2            | 0.1           | 0.1            | 0.1            | 0.2             |\n\nAave V2 Avalanche\n\n|                  | USDT           | WAVAX           | WETH            |\n|:-----------------|:---------------|:----------------|:----------------|\n| Optimal          | 0.8            | **0.45 → 0.65** | **0.45 → 0.65** |\n| Variable Base    | 0.0            | 0.0             | 0.0             |\n| Variable Slope 1 | 0.04           | **0.07 → 0.06** | **0.07 → 0.04** |\n| Variable Slope 2 | **0.75 → 1.0** | 3.0             | **3.0 → 1.0**   |\n| Stable Base      | 0.035          | 0.05            | 0.03            |\n| Stable Slope 1   | 0.02           | 0.0             | 0.0             |\n| Stable Slope 2   | **0.75 → 1.0** | 0.0             | 0.0             |\n| Reserve Factor   | 0.1            | 0.15            | 0.1             |\n\nAave V2 Polygon\n\n|                  | USDT          | WBTC            | WETH            | WMATIC          |\n|:-----------------|:--------------|:----------------|:----------------|:----------------|\n| Optimal          | **0.9 → 0.8** | 0.65            | 0.65            | **0.45 → 0.65** |\n| Variable Base    | 0.0           | 0.0             | 0.0             | 0.0             |\n| Variable Slope 1 | 0.04          | **0.08 → 0.04** | **0.08 → 0.04** | **0.07 → 0.06** |\n| Variable Slope 2 | **0.6 → 1.0** | 3.0             | 1.0             | 3.0             |\n| Stable Base      | 0.035         | 0.03            | 0.03            | 0.05            |\n| Stable Slope 1   | 0.02          | 0.1             | 0.1             | 0.1             |\n| Stable Slope 2   | **0.6 → 1.0** | 3.0             | 1.0             | 3.0             |\n| Reserve Factor   | 0.1           | 0.2             | 0.1             | 0.2             |\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis proposal implements the above changes on Aave V2 Ethereum and Polygon via the following pre-deployed payloads:\n  - Ethereum: [`0x24bdacf6bbebaf567123da16cdb79a266597e92b`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x24bdacf6bbebaf567123da16cdb79a266597e92b)\n  - Polygon: [`0xf22c8255ea615b3da6ca5cf5aecc8956bff07aa8`](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xf22c8255ea615b3da6ca5cf5aecc8956bff07aa8)\n\nAave V2 Avalanche changes will be implemented using a separate steward, deployed here:  [`0xe1dd796dbeb5a67ce37cbc52dcd164d0535c901e`](https://snowtrace.io/address/0xe1dd796dbeb5a67ce37cbc52dcd164d0535c901e)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.

Each asset is currently at, or nearing, 100% utilisation.  Some assets are receiving deposit rewards from Lido DAO.\n\nIncreasing the Supply Caps will enable users to enter yield maximising strategies, creating borrowing demand for network tokens that generates revenue for Aave DAO.\n\nEach of the parameter changes presented have been reviewed and are endorsed by at least one risk service provider. \n\n# Motivation\n\n## stMATIC Supply Cap Polygon\n\nRecently, the Supply Cap of stMATIC was increased from 21M units to 25M units. Within a few days, the Supply Cap was reached.\n\n![](../assets/AAVE-V3-MULTI-CAPS-UPDATES-20230508/supplycapreached.png)\n\nThe above chart shows the pent up demand awaiting Supply Cap increases. The right most part of the chart shows a rapid increase in utilisation as soon as the Supply Cap was lifted.\n\nThe recent increase in stMATIC deposits is from users entering the yield maximising strategy. This type of interaction with Aave Protocol is deemed lower risk than borrowing less price correlated assets.\n\n![](../assets/AAVE-V3-MULTI-CAPS-UPDATES-20230508/tokensupply.png)\n\nThe chart above shows that the supply of stMATIC on Polygon has only increased notably over the last few days. 50% of supply is 25,825,944 which can be rounded to 25.8M units. This AIP presents a stMATIC Supply Cap of 30M units, or 58.08% of supply.\n\n## wstETH Supply Cap Polygon\n\nCurrent utilisation of the wstETH Supply Cap is 100%. Supply of wstETH on Polygon is [4,034 units](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x03b54a6e9a984069379fae1a4fc4dbae93b3bccd). \n\nAs the majority of larger holdings are entering into the yield maximising strategy and the oracle draws upon liquidity from DEXs across various networks and CEX, Aave Protocol can be more flexible with setting the Supply Cap.\n\nAs a result, this AIP will implement a Supply Cap that is approximately 59.49% of supply. This is equivalent to a 33% increase in the Supply Cap.\n\n## wstETH Supply Cap Arbitrum\n\nThe wstETH Supply Cap on Arbitrum v3 is at 100% utilisation. \n\nThere is ample liquidity for wstETH to wETH to USDC swaps to occur when liquidating the largest wstETH holdings. At the time of writing, wstETH supply on Arbitrum is [34,699.59 units](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x5979d7b546e38e414f7e9822514be443a4800529), 50% of the supply is 17.35k units.

For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-interest-rate-curve-recommendations-from-gauntlet-2023-04-27/12921).\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nGiven the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet’s platform has evaluated all assets on Aave V3’s active markets and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol. Our methodology makes data-informed decisions around setting borrower and supplier interest rates when market conditions require the protocol to reduce risk or when strategic opportunities present themselves to increase protocol revenue without materially impacting risk. This analysis further finetunes the interest rate curves of Aave V3 across the Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Optimism markets.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAave V3 Ethereum\n\n|                    | CRV            | USDC             | USDT            | WBTC            |\n|:-------------------|:---------------|:-----------------|:----------------|:----------------|\n| Optimal            | 0.7            | 0.9              | **0.9 → 0.8**   | 0.45            |\n| Variable Base      | 0.03           | 0.0              | 0.0             | 0.0             |\n| Variable Slope 1   | 0.14           | **0.04 → 0.035** | 0.04            | **0.07 → 0.04** |\n| Variable Slope 2   | 3.0            | 0.6              | **0.72 → 0.75** | 3.0             |\n| Stable Base Offset | 0.03           | 0.01             | 0.01            | 0.02            |\n| Stable Slope 1     | 0.08           | 0.005            | 0.04            | 0.07            |\n| Stable Slope 2     | 3.0            | 0.6              | 0.72            | 3.0             |\n| Reserve Factor     | **0.2 → 0.35** | 0.1              | 0.1             | 0.2             |\n\nAave V3 Polygon\n\n|                    | CRV            | DPI            | EURS            | USDC             | WBTC            |\n|:-------------------|:---------------|:---------------|:----------------|:-----------------|:----------------|\n| Optimal            | 0.7            | 0.45           | 0.8             | 0.9              | 0.45            |\n| Variable Base      | 0.03           | 0.0            | 0.0             | 0.0              | 0.0             |\n| Variable Slope 1   | 0.14           | **0.07 → 0.1** | **0.04 → 0.06** | **0.04 → 0.035** | **0.07 → 0.04** |\n| Variable Slope 2   | 3.0            | 3.0            | 0.75            | 0.6              | 3.0             |\n| Stable Base Offset | 0.03           | 0.02           | 0.01            | 0.01             | 0.02            |\n| Stable Slope 1     | 0.08           | 0.0            | 0.005           | 0.005            | 0.0             |\n| Stable Slope 2     | 3.0            | 0.0            | 0.75            | 0.6              | 0.0             |\n| Reserve Factor     | **0.2 → 0.35** | 0.35           | 0.1             | 0.1              | 0.2             |\n\nAave V3 Avalanche\n\n|                    | USDC             | WBTC            |\n|:-------------------|:-----------------|:----------------|\n| Optimal            | 0.9              | 0.45            |\n| Variable Base      | 0.0              | 0.0             |\n| Variable Slope 1   | **0.04 → 0.035** | **0.07 → 0.04** |\n| Variable Slope 2   | 0.6              | 3.0             |\n| Stable Base Offset | 0.01             | 0.02            |\n| Stable Slope 1     | 0.005            | 0.0             |\n| Stable Slope 2     | 0.6              | 0.0             |\n| Reserve Factor     | 0.1              | 0.2             |\n\nAave V3 Arbitrum\n\n|                    | EURS            | USDC             | WBTC            |\n|:-------------------|:----------------|:-----------------|:----------------|\n| Optimal            | 0.8             | 0.9              | 0.45            |\n| Variable Base      | 0.0             | 0.0              | 0.0             |\n| Variable Slope 1   | **0.04 → 0.06** | **0.04 → 0.035** | **0.07 → 0.04** |\n| Variable Slope 2   | 0.75            | 0.6              | 3.0             |\n| Stable Base Offset | 0.01            | 0.01             | 0.02            |\n| Stable Slope 1     | 0.005           | 0.005            | 0.0             |\n| Stable Slope 2     | 0.75            | 0.6              | 0.0             |\n| Reserve Factor     | 0.1             | 0.1              | 0.2             |\n\nAave V3 Optimism\n\n|                    | USDC             | WBTC            |\n|:-------------------|:-----------------|:----------------|\n| Optimal            | 0.9              | 0.45            |\n| Variable Base      | 0.0              | 0.0             |\n| Variable Slope 1   | **0.04 → 0.035** | **0.07 → 0.04** |\n| Variable Slope 2   | 0.6              | 3.0             |\n| Stable Base Offset | 0.01             | 0.02            |\n| Stable Slope 1     | 0.005            | 0.0             |\n| Stable Slope 2     | 0.6              | 0.0             |\n| Reserve Factor     | 0.1              | 0.2             |\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal implements changes on Aave V3 Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism using the following pre-deployed payloads:\n  -

      "description": "\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes increasing the MaticX Supply Cap on Polygon v3 from 17.2M units to 29.3M units.\n\n# Abstract\n\nAfter a vote for increasing the communities counter party risk was passed on Snapshot, the Supply Cap for MaticX can be increased from 50% to 75% of circulating supply.\n\nThe dominant use case for MaticX on Aave Protocol is as collateral to borrow wMATIC. Since the MaticX oracle, a calculated price feed provided by Chainlink based upon the underlying asset's (MATIC) price, the risk of liquidation is minimal. As a result, the primary risk of increasing aave Protocol's exposure to MaticX is the assocaited counterparty risk which is expressed as concentration risk with up to 75% of supply on the Polygon network.\n\nThe current Supply Cap's utilisation is hovering around 94%, with 1.03M units of MaticX deposit capacity. Stader Labs is currently offering SD rewards to user who deposit MaticX. This proposal seeks to encourage Stader Labs to continue distributing SD rewards by increasing the Supply Cap and enabling more MaticX to be deposited into Aave. \n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions conducive to growing TVL and Revenue by facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. \n\nWith liquidity mining ongoing, MaticX deposit rewards (SD) and wMATIC borrowing rewards (stMATIC & MaticX), ensuring there is adequate capacity enabling the yield maximising strategies to grow is key for Aave Protcol's abililty to generate wMATIC revenue. Several liquidity pools on Balancer v2 now include bb-a-wMATIC with over 14.5M units of wMATIC being deposited in Aave Protocol. This has lead to reduced borrowing rates for wMATIC and supports the continued growth of yield maximising strategies on Aave Protocol. \n\n![](../assets/AAVE-V3-POLYGON-CAPS-UPDATES-AGD-APPROVAL-20230503/chart.png)\n\nTo facilitate the continued growth of the MaticX reserve, the Supply Cap needs to be raised enabling more deposits into the reserve.\n\nWith reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/1) the preferred path forward is to implement several upgrades to gradually increase Aave's MaticX exposure over time. \n\nThis proposal will increase the Supply Cap from 17.2M units to  29.3M units.

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal fixes an issue created by proposal 224 on WETH, WTBC, USDT and WMATIC of Aave v2 Polygon, by connecting new rate strategy contracts with exactly the same approved parameters on 224, but this time fully compatible with v2 Polygon.\n\n## Motivation\n\nProposal 224 updated the interest rate strategies of different assets on Aave v2 Ethereum and Polygon. Even if this worked perfectly fine on Ethereum, due to legacy reasons, Aave v2 Polygon requires slightly different interface on the rates strategy contracts, for them to be compatible with the LendingPool.\nThe new rate strategies connected on proposal 224 for WETH, WMATIC, WBTC and USDT lacked this compatibility, which doesn't allow for user actions to be performed, when involving those assets.\nEven if not putting any funds at risk, this is a problem for users and integrators of Aave v2 Polygon, so this new proposal applies a patch.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis is a cross-chain governance proposal, targeting Aave v2 Polygon.\n\nUpon execution, the proposal will:\n\n- call `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.setReserveInterestRateStrategyAddress(ASSET)` for each of the assets WETH, WBTC, WMATIC and USDT, on Aave v2 Polygon\n\n## Security and additional considerations\n\nThe following verification/test have been made on this proposal:\n\n- Diff reports on configuration parameters of all Aave v2 Polygon listed assets: everything should be exactly the same as before, as parameters don't change; only the Solidity code of the interest rate strategies.\n\n- Diff reports on the Solidity code of the new interest rate strategies, to check that compared with the current interest rate strategies of the affected assets (wrong), the new ones have an extra function, which is the required by the LendingPool:\n\n```\nfunction calculateInterestRates(\n    address reserve,\n    address aToken,\n    uint256 liquidityAdded,\n    uint256 liquidityTaken,\n    uint256 totalStableDebt,\n    uint256 totalVariableDebt,\n    uint256 averageStableBorrowRate,\n    uint256 reserveFactor\n  ) external view override returns (uint256, uint256, uint256)\n```\n\n- Post-execution actions tests, more specifically supplying liquidity on WETH, WBTC, WMATIC and USDT. The revert() caused by proposal 224 boils down to `ReserveLogic.updateInterestRates()`, function used on all pool actions to retrieve the current rate from the rate strategy. `deposit()` working implies the logic of calling the new rate strategy works for all actions.\n\n## References\n\n**Proposal 224 creating the problem**\n\n[https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/224/](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/224/)\n\n**Disclosure of the issue**\n\n[https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v2-interest-rate-curve-recommendations-from-gauntlet-2023-04-21/12846/11](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v2-interest-rate-curve-recommendations-from-gauntlet-2023-04-21/12846/11)\n\n**Tests**\n\n[https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2PolygonIR_20230519/AaveV2PolygonIR_20230519.t.sol](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2PolygonIR_20230519/AaveV2PolygonIR_20230519.t.sol)\n\n**Diffs**\n\n[https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/tree/main/src/AaveV2PolygonIR_20230519/current-new.md](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/tree/main/src/AaveV2PolygonIR_20230519/current-new.md)\n\n\n**Proposal payload (Polygon)**\n\n[https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2PolygonIR_20230519/AaveV2PolygonIR_20230519.sol](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2PolygonIR_20230519/AaveV2PolygonIR_20230519.sol)\n\n[Payload: 0x7e1f23bdFc7287AF276F77B5A867e85cf0377a31](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x7e1f23bdFc7287AF276F77B5A867e85cf0377a31#code)\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n# Summary\n\nThis AIP proposes increasing the wMATIC Supply and Borrow Cap on Polygon v3.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWith strong deposit flows from the Balancer bb-a-wMATIC integration and the continual growth of the yield maximising strategy, the Supply and Borrow Cap of wMATIC are both experiencing strong utilisation.\n\nThis AIP enables the continued growth of wMATIC deposits as Balancer Liquidity Providers migrate to the new gauges and users continue to migrate from Aave v2 to v3. As wMATIC deposits grow so does the demand for borrowing wMATIC. Subsidised borrowing costs has lead to significant demand for wMATIC and TVL growth for Aave.\n\nIncreasing the Supply and Borrow Caps as outlined will continue to users of yield maximising strategies.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith several Balancer liquidity pools depositing wMATIC into Aave v3 on Polygon, the utilisation of the Supply Cap has increased to 100%. This is currently preventing the Balancer linear pools from depositing into the wMATIC reserve. \n\nCurrently, there is around [5,294,939](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x8159462d255c1d24915cb51ec361f700174cd99400000000000000000000075d) and [1,228,487](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0xb20fc01d21a50d2c734c4a1262b4404d41fa7bf000000000000000000000075c) units of wMATIC not yet migrated to the new gauges. The wMATIC Supply Cap is at 100% utilisation.\n\nThere is also [15.13M](https://app.aave.com/markets/?marketName=proto_polygon) units of wMATIC on Aave v2 that has not yet migrated to v3. \n\nCollectively, this represents around 21.65M units of wMATIC relative to a Supply Cap. This AIP intends to provide sufficent capacity for the 21.65M units to be deposited into the wMATIC reserve by increasing the Supply Cap from 66M units to 90M units, a 24M unit increase. The utilisation of the pool will be 73.33% after the Supply Cap is implemented.\n\nWith many teams are offering yield maximising strategies, there is continued strong demand for borrowing wMATIC. The current Borrow Cap has reached 74.50% utilisation. The newly proposed Borrow Cap 50M units is equivalent to 25% increase and represents 62.5% of the Supply Cap.\n\nWith reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/1) it is possible to ship several upgrades to gradually increasing Aave's exposure to wMATIC over time.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters have been proposed by Llama and Chaos Labs has expressed support on the governance forum.\n\nTicker: wMATIC\n\nContract: [`polygon: 0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270`](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270)\n\n|Parameter|Current Value|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|SupplyCap|66.00M units|90M units|\n|BorrowCap|39.95M units|50M units|\n\n# Implementation\n\nA list of relevant links like for this proposal:\n\n* [Governance Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-wmatic-supply-borrow-cap-increase-polygon-v3/13095)\n* [Test Cases](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3CapsUpdates_20230518/AaveV3PolCapsUpdates_20230518_PayloadTest.t.sol)\n* [Payload Implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3CapsUpdates_20230518/AaveV3PolCapsUpdates_20230518_Payload.sol)\n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

E-mode, in particular, unlocks capital efficiency with specific risk tradeoffs.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThese changes apply to V3 Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum.\n\nThe complete list of updates are:\n- Avalanche:\n    1. Lower Stablecoin E-Mode LT from 97.5% to 95%.\n    4. Lower Stablecoin E-Mode LTV from 97% to 93%.\n- Optimism:\n    1. Lower Stablecoin E-Mode LT from 97.5% to 95%.\n    4. Lower Stablecoin E-Mode LTV from 97% to 93%.\n- Polygon:\n    1. Lower Stablecoin E-Mode LT from 97.5% to 95%.\n    7. Lower Stablecoin E-Mode LTV from 97% to 93%.\n- Arbitrum:\n    1. Lower Stablecoin E-Mode LT from 97.5% to 95%.\n    4. Lower Stablecoin E-Mode LTV from 97% to 93%.\n\nNote that the Stablecoin E-Mode LB is already 1% across all four aforementioned chains, and that Stablecoin E-Mode has category ID = 1 across all four aforementioned chains.\n\nWe recommend that users adjust their positions accordingly.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal implements changes on Aave V3 Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum using the following pre-deployed payloads:\n  - Optimism: [`0xf22c8255ea615b3da6ca5cf5aecc8956bff07aa8`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xf22c8255ea615b3da6ca5cf5aecc8956bff07aa8)\n  - Arbitrum: [`0x142dcaec322aaa25141b2597bf348487adbd596d`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x142dcaec322aaa25141b2597bf348487adbd596d)\n  - Polygon: [`0x24bdacf6bbebaf567123da16cdb79a266597e92b`](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x24bdacf6bbebaf567123da16cdb79a266597e92b)\n\nChanges on Avalanche can be implemented using the pre-deployed steward located at [`0xfc7b55cc7c5bd3ae89ac679c7250ab30754c5cc5`](https://snowtrace.io/address/0xfc7b55cc7c5bd3ae89ac679c7250ab30754c5cc5)\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis governance proposal grants the `RISK_ADMIN` role to a `CapsPlusRiskStewards` smart contract on each network with an active instance of Aave v3.\nOnce the `CapsPlusRiskStewards` has received the `RISK_ADMIN` role, the `RISK_COUNCIL` can adjust asset borrow/supply caps upwards without voting overhead. The `RISK_COUNCIL` is a Gnosis Safe controlled by the DAOs risk-providers (Gauntlet, Chaos Labs).\n\n## Motivation\n\nDuring the last months, for the broad majority of proposals regarding caps updates, the support of the community has been almost unanimous, with 1 or 2 exceptions.\nThe rationale of this is pretty clear: caps updates usually simply depend on the “green light” from the risk providers (Gauntlet, Chaos Labs)\nAs both providers have historically been in agreement with the updates proposed, the community has just followed that recommendation by supporting on-chain.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the community has important voting overhead in this scenario, which could be almost completely automated and simplified. It is quite common to have a proposal with unanimous support on day 1 of voting but given all other time considerations, execution is 3 to 5 days after.\n\nThis proposal gives the necessary `RISK_ADMIN` role to the `CapsPlusRiskSteward` introduced in this [governance forum thread](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-risk-steward-phase-1-capsplusrisksteward/12602).\nAfter execution, the `RISK_COUNCIL` will be able to perform cap increases through the `CapsPlusRiskStewards` under the following conditions for each asset listed:\n\n- the cap can only be adjusted upwards\n- the cap can never be increased by more than 100%\n- the cap can only be adjusted once every 5 days\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal's payload executes `ACL_MANAGER.addRiskAdmin(STEWARD)` where `STEWARD` is the `CapsPlusRiskStewards` pre-deployed on the respective network.\n\n## Security procedures\n\nThe `CapsPlusRiskStewards` is [unit tested](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-helpers/blob/master/src/test/riskstewards/CapsPlusRiskSteward.t.sol).\n\nThe proposal execution is simulated [within the tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3RiskSteward_20230404/AaveV3RiskSteward_20230404_Test.t.sol).\n\n## Deployed Contracts\n\n- CapsPlusRiskSteward:\n  [arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xADf86b537eF08591c2777E144322E8b0Ca7E82a7#code#F1#L1),\n  [avalanche](https://snowtrace.io/address/0xd2c92b5a793e196ab11dbefbe3af6bdded6c3dd5#code#F1#L1),\n  [mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x82dcCF206Ae2Ab46E2099e663F70DeE77caE7778#code#F1#L1),\n  [metis](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0x5f4d15d761528c57a5C30c43c1DAb26Fc5452731/contracts#address-tabs),\n  [optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5E76E98E0963EcDC6A065d1435F84065b7523f39#code#F1#L1),\n  [polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xc5de989E0D1BF605d19478Fdd32Aa827a10b464f#code#F1#L1)\n- Payloads:\n  [arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xe79ca44408dae5a57ea2a9594532f1e84d2edaa4#code#F1#L1),\n  [avalanche](https://snowtrace.io/address/0x7e1f23bdfc7287af276f77b5a867e85cf0377a31#code#F1#L1),\n  [mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/https://etherscan.io/address/0x90127a46207e97e4205db5ccc1ec9d6d43633fd4#code#F1#L1),\n  [metis](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0xd91d1331db4F436DaF47Ec9Dd86deCb8EEF946B4/contracts#address-tabs),\n  [optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xA3e44d830440dF5098520F62Ebec285B1198c51E#code#F1#L1),\n  [polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x4C0633Bf70fB2bB984A9eEC5d9052BdEA451C70A#code#F1#L1)\n\n## References\n\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xc882bf5f0f0f801591bfd5f0273388ea154654220f472aa4a06fd1fe6b94bb53)\n- [Discussion: CapsPlusRiskSteward](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-risk-steward-phase-1-capsplusrisksteward/12602/1)\n- [Discussion: caps update framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/4)\n- [Discussion: fast track process](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-v3-supply-borrow-cap-management-fast-track-process/8045)\n- [Code: ProposalPayload](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3RiskSteward_20230404/AaveV3RiskSteward_20230404.sol)\n- [Code: Payload Tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3RiskSteward_20230404/AaveV3RiskSteward_20230404_Test.t.sol)\n- [Code: CapsPlusRiskSteward](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-helpers/blob/master/src/riskstewards/CapsPlusRiskSteward.sol)\n- [Code: CapsPlusRiskSteward Tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-helpers/blob/master/src/test/riskstewards/CapsPlusRiskSteward.t.sol)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\nThis proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as part of FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Optimism liquidity pool.\n\n## Motivation\nDeFi Saver has a long-standing history of synergies with the Aave Protocol, being one of the first third-party integrations of Aave V1 in 2020.\n\nCurrently, every flashloan has a 9 bps fee that rewards liquidity providers in Aave. While flashloans were created by Aave, the ecosystem as a whole has replicated this feature, and most protocols do not implement any fees.\n\nThe ACI does not support waiving the fees for flashloans in general, as we firmly believe that users’ funds used, even in the context of a single transaction, should be rewarded.\n\nHowever, some strategic use cases of V3, such as emode, are very fee-sensitive as they mobilize high leverage. Waiving the DeFi Saver flashloan fees is expected to make these strategies more convenient and profitable, leading to increased borrow volume and thus increased Aave DAO revenue.\n\nThis proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as a part of FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 Optimism liquidity pool.\n\nThis AIP present Aave with the same code as [AIP-196](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/196/) but due to  a failed execution of the Optimism payload on the OP side of the cross-chain governance bridge, we are resubmitting it.\nCode stays unchanged.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis AIP aims to implement a single payload, which will simply call addFlashBorrower() on the ACL_MANAGER contract.\n\n```solidity\n\ncontract AaveV3OptDFSFlashBorrowActivation is IProposalGenericExecutor {\n  address public constant FL_AAVE_V3 = 0xfbcF23D2BeF8A2C491cfa4dD409D8dF12d431c85;\n  address public constant FL_ACTION = 0xE668197A175E7A2143222a028470c6ABBBD183F6;\n\n  function execute() external {\n    AaveV3Optimism.ACL_MANAGER.addFlashBorrower(FL_AAVE_V3);\n    AaveV3Optimism.ACL_MANAGER.addFlashBorrower(FL_ACTION);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n\nA list of relevant links like for this proposal:\n\n- [forum discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-defi-saver-to-flashborrowers-on-aave-v3/12410)\n- [tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3DFSFlashBorrow_20230403/AaveV3ETHDFSFlashBorrowActivation_20230403_test.t.sol)\n- [proposalCode](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3DFSFlashBorrow_20230524/AaveV3DFSFlashBorrow_20230524.sol)\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal changes the following price adapters and price oracle sentinel:\n\n- WBTC on Ethereum v2 to the custom `WBTC / BTC / ETH`\n- wstETH on Optimism and Arbitrum v3 to `wstETH / ETH / USD`\n- MATICX on Polygon v3 to the custom adapter, which uses `MATIC / USD` CL feed and `MATICX / MATIC` on-chain rate\n- stMATIC on Polygon v3 to the custom adapter, which utilizes `MATIC / USD` CL feed and `stMATIC / MATIC` on-chain rate\n- price oracle sentinel is configured for Optimism V3\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe current price feeds for certain ETH and MATIC LSTs can result in artificial volatility due to de-synchronization between different asset/PEG feeds.\nAdditionally, the Aave community already pre-approved pricing `WBTC` on Aave v2 based on a WBTC feed, and not assuming that its price is the one provided by BTC/ETH.\n\nTo address this problem and enhance the stability of the Aave platform, we propose to change the price feeds for wstETH on Optimism and Arbitrum to a [custom price adapter](https://github.com/bgd-labs/cl-synchronicity-price-adapter/blob/main/src/contracts/CLSynchronicityPriceAdapterPegToBase.sol) that calculates the `wstETH / ETH / USD` price and is based on Chainlink's feeds under the hood. The same approach is already used for the wstETH on Polygon and WBTC on Aave V3.\n\nWBTC price feed will use the same [adapter implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/cl-synchronicity-price-adapter/blob/main/src/contracts/CLSynchronicityPriceAdapterPegToBase.sol), but with the `WBTC / BTC / ETH` inside.\n\nMaticX and stMatic price feeds will be swapped for a [special adapter](https://github.com/bgd-labs/cl-synchronicity-price-adapter/blob/main/src/contracts/MaticSynchronicityPriceAdapter.sol), which utilizes on-chain rate.\n\nAs the Chainlink sequencer feed is available for Optimism, it also makes sense to configure the price oracle sentinel for Aave V3 Optimism, so that all L2 Aave V3 markets where the the Chainlink feed is available, are in sync.\n\n## Specification\n\nUpon execution, the proposal will:\n\n- call `ORACLE.setAssetSources([0x2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599], [0xFD858c8bC5ac5e10f01018bC78471bb0DC392247])` to replace the price source for `WBTC` on Aave v2\n- call `AaveV3Optimism.POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.setPriceOracleSentinel(0xB1ba0787Ca0A45f086F8CA03c97E7593636E47D5)` to set the price oracle sentinel on the pool addresses provider\n- use Config Engine to update `wstETH` price feed to [0x05225Cd708bCa9253789C1374e4337a019e99D56](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x05225cd708bca9253789c1374e4337a019e99d56) on Optimism\n- use Config Engine to update `wstETH` price feed to [0x3105C276558Dd4cf7E7be71d73Be8D33bD18F211](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3105c276558dd4cf7e7be71d73be8d33bd18f211) on Arbitrum\n- use Config Engine to update `MATICX` price feed to [0x0e1120524e14Bd7aD96Ea76A1b1dD699913e2a45](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3105c276558dd4cf7e7be71d73be8d33bd18f211) on Polygon\n- use Config Engine to update `stMATIC` price feed to [0xEe96b77129cF54581B5a8FECCcC50A6A067034a1](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3105c276558dd4cf7e7be71d73be8d33bd18f211) on Polygon\n\n## Security and additional considerations\n\nCustom price adapters are already widely used in the system for price-correlated assets and were [reviewed by the auditors](https://github.com/bgd-labs/cl-synchronicity-price-adapter).\n\n- **MaticX Historical Feeds Comparison**: Comparing the answers from the current feed with the new one for the last 280 days (since CL feed was deployed) with a 4-hour step gave the following results:\n\n  - 35.91% of results differ for less than 0.1%\n  - 62.06% have between 0.1% and 0.5% difference\n  - 2.03% is between 0.5% and 1%\n\nWe also additionally double-checked all points of centralisation of MaticX to be sure that no on-chain manipulation of rates is possible.\n\n- **stMatic Historical Feeds Comparison**: Comparing the answers from the current feed with the new one for the last 327 days (since CL feed was deployed) with a 4-hour step gave the following results:\n  - 95.39% of results differ for less than 0.1%\n  - 4.5% have between 0.1% and 0.5% difference\n  - 0.11% is between 0.5% and 1%\n\nAll points of centralisation of stMatic were also checked to be sure that on-chain manipulation of rates is impossible.\n\n## References\n\nTests: [Ethereum V2](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230504/AaveV2PriceFeedsUpdate_20230504_PayloadTest.t.sol), [Optimism](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230504/AaveV3OptPriceFeedsUpdate_20230504_PayloadTest.t.sol), [Arbitrum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230504/AaveV3ArbPriceFeedsUpdate_20230504_PayloadTest.t.sol), [Polygon](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230504/AaveV3PolPriceFeedsUpdate_20230504_PayloadTest.t.sol)\n\nProposal payload implementation: [Ethereum V2](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230504/AaveV2PriceFeedsUpdate_20230504_Payload.sol), [Optimism](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230504/AaveV3OptPriceFeedsSentinelUpdate_20230504_Payload.sol), [Arbitrum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230504/AaveV3ArbPriceFeedsUpdate_20230504_Payload.sol), [Polygon](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230504/AaveV3PolPriceFeedsUpdate_20230504_Payload.sol)\n\nPrice Adapters: [WBTC](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFD858c8bC5ac5e10f01018bC78471bb0DC392247), [wstETH Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x05225cd708bca9253789c1374e4337a019e99d56), [wstETH Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3105c276558dd4cf7e7be71d73be8d33bd18f211), [MaticX](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x0e1120524e14bd7ad96ea76a1b1dd699913e2a45), [stMATIC](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xee96b77129cf54581b5a8fecccc50a6a067034a1)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The proposal executes the following commands:\n\n- `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.updateAToken`\n- `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.updateStableDebtToken`\n- `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.updateVariableDebtToken`\n- `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.setReservePause(AaveV3ArbitrumAssets.MAI_UNDERLYING, false)`\n- `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.setReserveFlashLoaning(AaveV3ArbitrumAssets.MAI_UNDERLYING, true)`\n\n## References\n\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-mai-to-arbitrum-aave-v3-market/12759/8)\n- [Code:ArbPayload](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3OPARBMAIFixes_20230606/AaveV3ARBMAIFixes_20230606.sol)\n- [Code:ArbTest](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3OPARBMAIFixes_20230606/AaveV3ARBMAIFixes_20230606_Test.t.sol)\n- [Code:OptPayload](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3OPARBMAIFixes_20230606/AaveV3OPMAIFixes_20230606.sol)\n- [Code:OptTest](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3OPARBMAIFixes_20230606/AaveV3OPMAIFixes_20230606_Test.t.sol)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

These incentives encourage users to deposit either Liquid Staking Token (LST) into Aave v3 Protocl.\n\nThis AIP, with support from Chaos Labs and a favourable Snapshot, shall increase the Supply Caps to enable users to deposit funds in the stMATIC and MaticX reserves on Polygon v3.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions on Aave v3 Polygon to facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. These products are now active with more soon to be deployed.\n\nWith conservative Supply Caps being implemented and filled within minutes, or hours, communities who have built products on Aave v3 are experiencing great frustration. After investing time, resources and incurring audit costs, these communities are unable to promote their products to prospective users without the newly implemented Supply Caps being filled.\n\nFor these integrations to be successful, the Supply Caps need to be increased such that a wide array of prospective users can enter into these automated strategies. Currently, the smaller Supply Cap increases are filling quickly and we are experiencing several whales / products absoring near 100% of newly implemented Supply Caps is not promoting a desirable UX for users.\n\nThe original ARFC links below:\n\n- [MaticX Forum Post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-polygon-supply-cap-update-23-05-2023/13190)\n- [stMATIC Forum Post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-polygon-v3-supply-cap-update-2023-05-21/13161)\n\nThe proposed Supply Caps are supported by Chaos Labs. However, Gauntlet has a more conservative risk model which limits the Supply Cap to 50% of supply on the network relative to Chaose Lab's 75%. This difference leads to differing Supply Cap recommendations. Do note, Aave DAO voted to increase the Supply Caps to [75%](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba) of supply.

Given the typically low borrowing cost for LSTs, users are able to borrow the LST and participate in yield strategies beyond the Aave protocol.\n\n# Motivation\n\nrETH is listed on Aave v3 Ethereum and has over $20M of deposits. Rocket Pool is expanding its support for rETH across the L2 ecosystem, first Optimism, now Arbitrum and soon Polygon. There are currently only Chainlink Oracles for Arbitrum and Ethereum. This AIP focusses on listing rETH on Arbitrum.\n\nLST collateral types drive material borrowing revenue to Aave as users deposit the LST and borrow the corresponding network token. This is most evident on Ethereum where the LST-wETH-yield-maximising loop is the source of the vast majority of wETH borrowing demand.\n\nBy providing LST diversification, Aave presents itself as a neutral platform offering users the choice between various LSTs. An added benefit of offering a variety of LSTs is the respective communities may elect to compete for user acquisition via Aave through offering incentives. This is currently happening on Aave v3 Polygon and Aave’s TVL has meaningfully increased from a relatively small base.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe parameters shown below are the [combined recommendation](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-reth-to-aave-v3-arbitrum-liquidity-pool/12810/2) of Gauntlet and Chaos Labs.\n\nTicker: rETH\n\nContract Address: [`arbitrum: 0xec70dcb4a1efa46b8f2d97c310c9c4790ba5ffa8`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xec70dcb4a1efa46b8f2d97c310c9c4790ba5ffa8)\n\nChainlink Oracle rETH/ETH [`0xF3272CAfe65b190e76caAF483db13424a3e23dD2`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0411D28c94d85A36bC72Cb0f875dfA8371D8fFfF)\n\nNewly deployed Oracle rETH/ETH/USD [`0x04c28D6fE897859153eA753f986cc249Bf064f71`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x04c28D6fE897859153eA753f986cc249Bf064f71)\n\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap|325 units|\n|Borrow Cap|85 units|\n|LTV|67.00%|\n|LT|74.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|7.50%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|\n|Variable Slope 1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope 2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope 1|13.00%|\n|Stable Slope 2|300.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable to Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|\n|Flahloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n\n# Implementation\n\nA list of relevant links like for this proposal:\n\n* [Governance Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-reth-to-aave-v3-arbitrum-liquidity-pool/12810)\n* [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xa7bc42ca1f658655e9998d22d616133da734bad0e6caae9c7d016ad97abf1451)\n* [Test Cases](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3Listings_20230524/AaveV3ArbListings_20230524_PayloadTest.t.sol)\n* [Payload Implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3Listings_20230524/AaveV3ArbListings_20230524_Payload.sol)\n\nChaos Labs and Gauntlet both contributed to the development of the risk parameters presented above. \n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

As per this plan, Chaos Labs proposes to list ENS on Aave V3 on Ethereum. ENS is currently listed on V2 Ethereum with borrow disabled.\n\nAs the proposed assets in the migration plan are traded with relatively low market cap and trading volume, we have taken a prudent approach in setting borrow caps to account for no more than 1% of the average daily trading volume. The supply cap was derived using our supply cap methodology with the V2 data (simulation results can be seen in the image below).

As per this plan, Chaos Labs proposes to list 1INCH on Aave V3 on Ethereum. 1INCH is currently listed on V2 Ethereum with borrow disabled.\n\nAs the proposed assets in the migration plan are traded with relatively low market cap and trading volume, we have taken a prudent approach in setting borrow caps to account for no more than 1% of the average daily trading volume. The supply cap was derived using our supply cap methodology with the V2 data (simulation results can be seen in the image below).

This account borrows roughly $63m of USDST against $190m of CRV, as of 2023/06/13. We recommend to 1. freeze CRV collateral and 2. set Curve LTV to 0, to prevent the account from continuing to add CRV and increasing concentration risk, due to the decrease in CRV liquidity over the past few months.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nFreeze CRV, set CRV LTV -> 0 on Aave v2 Ethereum.\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal implements changes on Aave v2 Ethereum using the `freezeReserve` and `configureReserveAsCollateral` methods of the `LendingPoolConfigurator`.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.

      "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust fourteen (14) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across six (6) Aave V3 Ethereum assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nChaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt.\n\n_Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range._\n\nPlease find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).\n\nYou can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).\n\nThe output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC, WETH, WSTETH, LINK, DAI and USDC on V3 Ethereum, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with a negligible effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)\n\nSimulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$3.6M, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset  | Parameter             | Current | Recommended | Change |\n| ------ | --------------------- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |\n| WETH   | Liquidation Threshold | 82.5%   | 83%         | +0.5%  |\n| WETH   | Loan-to-Value         | 80%     | 80.5%       | +0.5%  |\n| WBTC   | Liquidation Threshold | 75%     | 78%         | +3%    |\n| WBTC   | Loan-to-Value         | 70%     | 73%         | +3%    |\n| WBTC   | Liquidation Penalty   | 6.25%   | 5%          | -1.25% |\n| DAI    | Liquidation Threshold | 77%     | 80%         | +3%    |\n| DAI    | Loan-to-Value         | 64%     | 67%         | +3%    |\n| USDC   | Liquidation Threshold | 76%     | 79%         | +3%    |\n| USDC   | Loan-to-Value         | 74%     | 77%         | +3%    |\n| LINK   | Liquidation Threshold | 65%     | 68%         | +3%    |\n| LINK   | Loan-to-Value         | 50%     | 53%         | +3%    |\n| LINK   | Liquidation Penalty   | 7.5%    | 7%          | -0.5%  |\n| WSTETH | Liquidation Threshold | 79.5%   | 80%         | +0.5%  |\n| WSTETH | Loan-to-Value         | 68.5%   | 69%         | +0.5%  |\n\n# References\n\n[Forum Post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-aave-v3-ethereum-2023-05-18/13128)\n\n[Test](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3EthRiskParams_20230529/AaveV3EthRiskParams_20230529_Test.t.sol)\n\n[Proposal payload implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3EthRiskParams_20230529/AaveV3EthRiskParams_20230529.sol)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal further updates price feeds of LSTs (in this case stETH/wstETH) to be priced based on the so-called exchange rate, and not on the secondary market (e.g. DEXes).\nThe changes are the following:\n\n- The feed of `stETH` on Aave v2 Ethereum will be a custom adapter, which will return 1:1 `stETH / ETH` value, as with stETH being a rebasing asset, that represents the stETH/ETH exchange rate.\n- The feeds for `wstETH` on Aave v3 Ethereum, Optimism, and Arbitrum will be custom adapters too (CL synchronicity), using the `wstETH / stETH` exchange rate and `ETH / USD` feed\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe assume the price of the `stETH` to be in the ration 1 to 1 to the price of the `ETH`, but the current price feed for `stETH` currently uses `stETH / ETH` feed, which is based on secondary market and can introduce additional unnecessary volatility of the asset. The same issue applies to the `wstETH` adapters, which are whether using a `stETH / ETH` or a `stETH / USD` feed inside.\n\nTo address the issue for `stETH` we are substituting the usage of the `stETH / ETH` feed by using the custom adapter, which returns constant 1:1 ratio.\n\nFor the `wstETH` adapters we are removing the usage of intermediate `stETH / ETH` feed or substituting `stETH / USD` for `ETH / USD` feed.\n\nAn update for wstETH on Aave v3 Polygon will be done in the close future to apply the same pricing strategy, once Chainlink provides a wstETH/stETH exchange rate feed.\n\n## Specification\n\nUpon execution, the proposal will:\n\n- call `ORACLE.setAssetSources([0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84], [0xADE6CBA6c45aa8E9d0337cAc3D2619eabc39D901])` to replace the price source for `stETH` on Aave v2 Ethereum\n- use Config Engine to update `wstETH` price feed to [0x8B6851156023f4f5A66F68BEA80851c3D905Ac93](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b6851156023f4f5a66f68bea80851c3d905ac93) on Aave v3 Ethereum\n- use Config Engine to update `wstETH` price feed to [0x945fD405773973d286De54E44649cc0d9e264F78](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x945fd405773973d286de54e44649cc0d9e264f78) on Aave v3 Optimism\n- use Config Engine to update `wstETH` price feed to [0x80f2c02224a2E548FC67c0bF705eBFA825dd5439](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x80f2c02224a2e548fc67c0bf705ebfa825dd5439) on Aave v3 Arbitrum\n\n## Security and additional considerations\n\nCustom price adapters are already widely used in the system for price-correlated assets and were [reviewed by the auditors](https://github.com/bgd-labs/cl-synchronicity-price-adapter).\n\n- **stETH / ETH Historical Comparison**: Comparing the ratio between `stETH` and `ETH` on the secondary market for the last half of a year:\n\n  - 30.96% of results differ for less than 0.1%\n  - 66.16% have between 0.1% and 0.5% difference\n  - 2.88% is between 0.5% and 1%\n\nThe same pattern applies to the deviation between new and existing `wstETH / USD` adapters.\n\nPreviously there were two major depeg events for the `stETH`:\n\n- In November 2022 difference was ~2% due to the FTX events and then got back to normal in about a month\n- In June 2022 deviation was about ~7% due to Terra events + withdrawals were not allowed yet at the moment\n\n## References\n\nTests: [Ethereum V2](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230613/AaveV2PriceFeedsUpdate_20230613_PayloadTest.t.sol), [Ethereum V3](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230613/AaveV3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230613_PayloadTest.t.sol), [Optimism](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230613/AaveV3OptPriceFeedsUpdate_20230613_PayloadTest.t.sol), [Arbitrum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230613/AaveV3ArbPriceFeedsUpdate_20230613_PayloadTest.t.sol)\n\nProposal payload implementation: [Ethereum V2](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230613/AaveV2PriceFeedsUpdate_20230613_Payload.sol), [Ethereum V3](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230613/AaveV3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230613_Payload.sol), [Optimism](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230613/AaveV3OptPriceFeedsUpdate_20230613_Payload.sol), [Arbitrum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2-V3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230613/AaveV3ArbPriceFeedsUpdate_20230613_Payload.sol)\n\nPrice Adapters: [stETH Ethereum v2](https://etherscan.io/address/0xade6cba6c45aa8e9d0337cac3d2619eabc39d901), [wstETH Ethereum v3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b6851156023f4f5a66f68bea80851c3d905ac93), [wstETH Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x80f2c02224a2e548fc67c0bf705ebfa825dd5439), [wstETH Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x945fd405773973d286de54e44649cc0d9e264f78)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal will convert Aave DAO's aBAL, aEthBAL, and BAL holdings, along with 326.88 wETH, on Ethereum to B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n# Abstract\n\nAave DAO will swap BAL and wETH for B-80BAL-20WETH via CoW Swap leveraging Milkman to protect the DAO from MEV exploits, incurring bad slippage and against reentrancy risk.\n\nThe methodology and payload have been developed and [tested](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x670b63d82a8d99b5aac74d25310e7ffa45c4dce2af9e1b5a265b0c84e90eba9f) in collaboration with Yearn Finance, CoW Swap, and Bored Ghosts Developing.\n\nAave DAO will convert 326.88 wETH plus all BAL, aBAL, and aEthBAL held within the Collector contract to B-80BAL-20WETH. Conversion of B-80BAL-20WETH to veBAL will occur via a separate proposal.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave DAO can utilize a veBAL holding in several ways, some of which are listed below:\n\n- Support GHO liquidity pools with BAL emissions\n- Direct BAL emissions to gauges where the BPT is listed as Collateral on Aave Protocol.\n- Direct BAL emissions to the B-80AAVE-20WSTETH gauge, and others, in support of the Safety Module.\n\nThe proposed B-80BAL-20WETH holding, when converted to veBAL is to support all the initiatives listed above. Aave DAO retains the ability to add to the veBAL position over time as the DAO determines its longer-term strategy.\n\nDetails of events to date can be found below:\n\n- [BAL <> AAVE token swap](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer-part-1/7617)\n- [100k BAL acquisition](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer-part-2/7813)\n\nFor an in-depth overview of the implementation, please see this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/deploy-bal-abal-from-the-collector-contract/9747/8).\n\nAt the time of writing Aave DAO owns 310,485.35 equivalent units of BAL at $4.50 for a total of $1,397,184.08.\n\n- [300,000.000 units](https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) of BAL\n- [10,054.76 units](https://etherscan.io/token/0x272f97b7a56a387ae942350bbc7df5700f8a4576?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) of aBAL\n- [430.59 units](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2516e7b3f76294e03c42aa4c5b5b4dce9c436fb8?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) of aethBAL\n\nA total of 326.88 wETH is to be converted to B-80BAL-20wETH. The wETH is valued at $563,868.00 based upon a $1,725 wETH price.\n\nThe estimated total value of the B-80BAL-20WETH holding is $1,961,052.08.\n\n[1 B-80BAL-20WETH = $12.56](https://etherscan.io/token/0x5c6ee304399dbdb9c8ef030ab642b10820db8f56)\n\nAave DAO can expect to receive approximately 156,134.72 units of B-80BAL-20WETH, minus price impact, etc. This places Aave DAO within the [top 15 B-80BAL-20WETH holders](https://dune.com/balancerlabs/veBAL-Analysis). When converted to veBAL, this is equivalent to 1.63% of the current veBAL supply.\n\n# Specification\n\nWe will be leveraging [Milkman](https://github.com/charlesndalton/milkman) to do a contract-to-contract interaction. This allows the DAO to avoid the need to interact with the CoW Swap API offchain and allows for onchain enforceable dynamic slippage protection. In other words, the trade will execute only if the buy amount is higher than the minimum defined by the Milkman contract instance.\n\nThe highest profile trade to date using Milkman is the [ENS trade](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-3/ep3.3-executable-sell-eth-to-usdc#specification).\n\nThe payload will do the following:\n\n1. Handle approvals and transfers from the Collector contract onto a newly deployed COWTrader.sol contract\n   a. Withdraw aBAL\n   b. Withdraw aEthBAL\n   c. Transfer all BAL now held in Collector to COWTrader.sol\n   d. Transfer specified wETH quantity to COWTrader.sol\n2. The COWTrader contract has one function to execute two trades using Milkman, utilizing its balance of wETH and BAL respectively. Both trades take the held token for B-80-BAL-20-WETH BPT.\n3. Milkman creates a new instance per trade, which will then hold the funds until the trades are settled via CoW Swap. Under the hood, Milkman approves CoW Swap's Settlement contract so it can transfer funds once there is a match.\n4. Once there is a match, the dynamic price checker will protect Aave's funds against a bad quote. If it passes our specified parameters, then the trade will go through and the Collector contract will receive B-80-BAL-20-WETH.\n\nIf everything goes well and the number of tokens to be received matches our parameters (slippage, price against our oracle) then the Collector contract will receive the BPT.\n\nThe trade can remain open in perpetuity until it is canceled or settled. The trade can be cancelled by either Aave Governance or an allowed Llama multi-sig. If cancelled, the tokens are sent automatically back to the collector.\n\n# Implementation\n\nA list of relevant links for this proposal:\n\n- [Governance Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-ethereum-collector-contract/12205)\n- [Test Cases](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2CollectorSwap80BAL20WETH_20230403/AaveV2CollectorSwapTest.t.sol)\n- [Payload Implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2CollectorSwap80BAL20WETH_20230403/AaveV2CollectorSwap80BAL20WETH_20230403_Payload.sol)\n- [Trade Contract](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2CollectorSwap80BAL20WETH_20230403/COWTrader.sol)\n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

No users funds are at risk.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWith SD, MaticX and stMATIC rewards being distributed across v3, Aave DAO can further encourage the migration of users to the safer v3 protocol. \n\nThis will be achieved by updating the Uoptimal, Reserve Factor (RF) and Slope2 parameters. This is expected to increase borrowing rates, with deposit rates remaining unchanged. \n\n# Motivation\n\nCurrently, there are two communities distributing three tokens across Polygon v3. \n\n* SD - Stader Labs\n* MaticX & stMATIC - Polygon Foundation\n\nThis has led to Polygon v3 offering better deposit rates relative to v2. The TVL on v3 is increasing, largely due to incentives and LSTs being added to the liquidity pool whilst v2's TVL remains more correlated to asset spot pricing.\n\nLiquidity Mining on v3 is encouraging users to migrate and this AIP will further encourage migration by holding v2 deposit rates constant and increasing v2 borrowing costs.\n\nThe approach presented has successfully passed [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x478169c0840488588b31d7e23b889b5f9442057db9c7a5b9b6cfdd61fe7108ff) and [ARFC](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x013f763e92d253926bc7f04d79138593a1b31c969a34db7f0955e46850c796d9) votes, with the community electing to migrate via Option 2, the conservative approach. \n\nThis AIP contains revised parameter updates in line with the ARFC Snapshot methodology.

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP propose to add the native USDC token issued by Circle to the Arbitrum V3 pool.\nCurrently onboarded USDC.e token will be kept as is and two USDC tokens will be available on the pool. The bridged asset USDC.e and the native USDC with the symbol USDCn.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCircle has launched a native version of USDC on Arbitrum, which is anticipated to become the primary version of the USDC stablecoin on the Arbitrum L2. This will supersede the current “USDC.e” token, which is a bridged asset with an underlying USDC on Ethereum.\n\nFrom our experience with the Avalanche Pool, we’ve learned that a prudent approach to integrating such a native token involves initially onboarding it with parameters similar to its bridged counterpart, but with more conservative caps. As the native USDC builds secondary liquidity and matures, we can gradually decrease the attractiveness of USDC.e and increase the caps for the native USDC.\n\nThis ARFC is focused solely on the onboarding of the native USDC and does not propose any action for USDC.e. As a result, if this proposal is accepted by the governance, both USDC.e and the native USDC will be onboarded simultaneously on the Arbitrum V3 pool. This strategy aims to ensure a smooth transition and maintain the stability of the Aave V3 pool on Arbitrum.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Token Information\n\n- Token Symbol: USDC\n- Token Address: [0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831)\n\nThe implementation of the token is the same as the one used for the USDC.e token.\nThe payload use a custom engine to avoid compatibility issues with the current USDC.e token and protocol version.\n\nwhile the protocol code use \"USDCn\" to distinguish both versions of the token. we recommend that UI supports USDCn with the symbol \"USDC\" to avoid confusion.\n\nLikewise, What the protocol consider \"USDC\" will be shown as \"USDC.e\" on the UI.\n\n```solidity\ncontract AaveV3ArbNativeUSDCListing_20230621 is AaveV3PayloadArbitrum {\n  address public constant USDCN = 0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831;\n  address public constant USDCN_PRICE_FEED =\n    0x50834F3163758fcC1Df9973b6e91f0F0F0434aD3;\n\n  function newListingsCustom()\n    public\n    pure\n    override\n    returns (IEngine.ListingWithCustomImpl[] memory)\n  {\n    IEngine.ListingWithCustomImpl[]\n      memory listings = new IEngine.ListingWithCustomImpl[](1);\n\n    listings[0] = IEngine.ListingWithCustomImpl(\n      IEngine.Listing({\n        asset: USDCN,\n        assetSymbol: \"USDCn\",\n        priceFeed: USDCN_PRICE_FEED,\n        rateStrategyParams: Rates.RateStrategyParams({\n          optimalUsageRatio: _bpsToRay(90_00),\n          baseVariableBorrowRate: 0,\n          variableRateSlope1: _bpsToRay(3_50),\n          variableRateSlope2: _bpsToRay(60_00),\n          stableRateSlope1: _bpsToRay(5_00),\n          stableRateSlope2: _bpsToRay(60_00),\n          baseStableRateOffset: _bpsToRay(1_00),\n          stableRateExcessOffset: _bpsToRay(8_00),\n          optimalStableToTotalDebtRatio: _bpsToRay(20_00)\n        }),\n        enabledToBorrow: EngineFlags.ENABLED,\n        stableRateModeEnabled: EngineFlags.DISABLED,\n        borrowableInIsolation: EngineFlags.ENABLED,\n        withSiloedBorrowing: EngineFlags.DISABLED,\n        flashloanable: EngineFlags.ENABLED,\n        ltv: 81_00,\n        liqThreshold: 86_00,\n        liqBonus: 5_00,\n        reserveFactor: 10_00,\n        supplyCap: 41_000_000,\n        borrowCap: 41_000_000,\n        debtCeiling: 0,\n        liqProtocolFee: 10_00,\n        eModeCategory: 1\n      }),\n      IEngine.TokenImplementations({\n        aToken: AaveV3Arbitrum.DEFAULT_A_TOKEN_IMPL_REV_2,\n        vToken: AaveV3Arbitrum.DEFAULT_VARIABLE_DEBT_TOKEN_IMPL_REV_2,\n        sToken: AaveV3Arbitrum.DEFAULT_STABLE_DEBT_TOKEN_IMPL_REV_2\n      })\n    );\n\n    return listings;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [Tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3ArbNativeUSDCListing_20230621/AaveV3ArbNativeUSDCListing_20230621Test.sol)\n- [proposalCode](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3ArbNativeUSDCListing_20230621/AaveV3ArbNativeUSDCListing_20230621.sol)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Unlike CRV (we will soon contribute further insights on this topic, as the complexity of the CRV market, primarily due to its substantial scale, warrants a more nuanced examination), these markets exhibit a more modest size and generally can be conveniently migrated. This diverges from preceding deliberations on market freezes prior to the V3 launch. With V3 live, invoking a freeze on V2 markets does not preclude users from capitalizing on these markets. Instead, it enhances the community’s capacity to safeguard user funds more effectively, as V3’s advanced risk management mechanisms provide a more secure environment. This proactive strategy aims to enforce a freeze on low-to-medium capital assets on V2, thereby averting a scenario resembling Aave V2’s current overexposure to CRV while permitting users to engage with Aave via V3 markets.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis AIP will call freezeReserve() method from the Aave V2 Pool Configurator contract for the following assets: 1INCH, ENS, LINK, MKR, SNX & UNI\n\n```solidity\ncontract AaveV2FreezeReserves_20230619 is IProposalGenericExecutor {\n  address public constant ONEINCH = AaveV2EthereumAssets.ONE_INCH_UNDERLYING;\n  address public constant ENS = AaveV2EthereumAssets.ENS_UNDERLYING;\n  address public constant LINK = AaveV2EthereumAssets.LINK_UNDERLYING;\n  address public constant MKR = AaveV2EthereumAssets.MKR_UNDERLYING;\n  address public constant SNX = AaveV2EthereumAssets.SNX_UNDERLYING;\n  address public constant UNI = AaveV2EthereumAssets.UNI_UNDERLYING;\n\n\n  function execute() external {\n    AaveV2Ethereum.POOL_CONFIGURATOR.freezeReserve(ONEINCH);\n    AaveV2Ethereum.POOL_CONFIGURATOR.freezeReserve(ENS);\n    AaveV2Ethereum.POOL_CONFIGURATOR.freezeReserve(LINK);\n    AaveV2Ethereum.POOL_CONFIGURATOR.freezeReserve(MKR);\n    AaveV2Ethereum.POOL_CONFIGURATOR.freezeReserve(SNX);\n    AaveV2Ethereum.POOL_CONFIGURATOR.freezeReserve(UNI);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [proposalCode](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2FreezeReserves_20230619/AaveV2FreezeReserves_20230619.sol)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV), for CRV on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing our recommendations to decrease Aave’s exposure to CRV on V2 Ethereum [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-recommendation-to-freeze-crv-and-set-crv-ltv-0-on-aave-v2/13644/31), we propose a series of LT and LTV reductions.\n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. To best minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings by a series of incremental decreases, following the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP. In an attempt to avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.\n\nIn the graph below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users. For the proposed, 3% LT decrease, the impact on users at the time of this post is negligible (2 accounts liquidated, ~3$ liquidated).\n\n| Liquidation Treshold | Accounts Liquidated | Liquidation Value |\n| -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |\n| 55                   | 2                   | ~3$               |\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recommended | Change |\n| ----- | --------- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |\n| CRV   | LT        | 58      | 55          | -3%    |\n| CRV   | LTV       | 52      | 49          | -3%    |\n\n## References\n\n- [Tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2CRVRiskParams_20230621/AaveV2CRVRiskParams_20230621Test.t.sol)\n- [Payload](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2CRVRiskParams_20230621/AaveV2CRVRiskParams_20230621.sol)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal further updates price feeds of LSTs (in this case wstETH) to be priced based on the so-called exchange rate, and not on the secondary market (e.g. DEXes).\nThe changes are the following:\n\n- The feed for `wstETH` on Aave v3 Polygon will be custom adapter (CL synchronicity), using the `wstETH / stETH` exchange rate and `ETH / USD` feed\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe assume the price of the `stETH` to be in the ration 1 to 1 to the price of the `ETH`, but the current price feed for `wstETH` currently uses `stETH / ETH` feed inside, which is based on secondary market and can introduce additional unnecessary volatility of the asset. We are removing the usage of intermediate `stETH / ETH` feed.\n\n## Specification\n\nUpon execution, the proposal will:\n\n- use Config Engine to update `wstETH` price feed to [0xe34949A48cd2E6f5CD41753e449bd2d43993C9AC](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xe34949a48cd2e6f5cd41753e449bd2d43993c9ac) on Aave v3 Polygon\n\n## Security and additional considerations\n\nCustom price adapters are already widely used in the system for price-correlated assets and were [reviewed by the auditors](https://github.com/bgd-labs/cl-synchronicity-price-adapter).\n\n- Comparing the answers between the new adapter and existing one showed that the difference did not exceed 1% during the last half of the year.\n\n## References\n\nTests: [Polygon](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230626/AaveV3PolPriceFeedsUpdate_20230626_PayloadTest.t.sol)\n\nProposal payload implementation: [Polygon](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3PriceFeedsUpdate_20230626/AaveV3PolPriceFeedsUpdate_20230626_Payload.sol)\n\nPrice Adapters: [wstETH Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xe34949a48cd2e6f5cd41753e449bd2d43993c9ac)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP propose to repay gas fees to recognized delegates who vote on-chain & deploy AIPs on Aave.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs Ethereum gas fees continue to rise, the cost of on-chain governance for delegates has proportionally increased.\n\nThis AIP proposes to repay gas fees to recognized delegates who vote on-chain & deploy AIPs on Aave.\n\nRebating delegates for their participation offers several benefits:\n- Encourages more active engagement from the delegate community by eliminating the disincentive to vote, leading to better decision-making for Aave.\n- Fosters a more diverse voter base, including student organizations, by reducing the barrier to entry for voting. This creates a more open and collaborative delegate ecosystem, driving participation.\n- Helps retain top delegates to foster the growth of the Aave ecosystem. Aave should remain competitive with its peers (e.g., Maker) to attract and retain the best delegate talent. The fundamental cost of being an excellent Aave delegate should not result in a net cost to the delegate due to ever-increasing gas costs.\n- Can be achieved at a relatively low cost. coverage of gas cost represent a small fraction of Aave protocol revenue.\n\n## Specification\n\nthis AIP call `transfer()` on the Aave collector contract to transfer the gas fees to the delegate addresses.\nwhile not complex this proposal payload is lenghty and to favor readability of this document, we invite the community willing to verify the payload code to refers to the references section link. \n\n## References\n\n- [Tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2DelegatesGasRebate_20230703/AaveV2EthBUSDIR_20230602Test.t.sol)\n- [proposalCode](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2DelegatesGasRebate_20230703/AaveV2DelegatesGasRebate_20230703.sol)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The objective is to mitigate the risk exposure associated with CRV and diminish its borrowing power, thereby aligning it more accurately with the existing market climate.\n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. We suggest reaching the desired settings with a series of incremental decreases to minimize this impact. This proposal recommends a slightly more aggressive reduction than the one discussed in the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, reducing the LT by 5%.\n\nChaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.\n\nIn the graph below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users.

Conversion of B-80BAL-20WETH to veBAL will occur via a separate proposal.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave DAO can utilize a veBAL holding in several ways, some of which are listed below:\n\n- Support GHO liquidity pools with BAL emissions\n- Direct BAL emissions to gauges where the BPT is listed as Collateral on Aave Protocol.\n- Direct BAL emissions to the B-80AAVE-20WSTETH gauge, and others, in support of the Safety Module.\n\nThe proposed B-80BAL-20WETH holding, when converted to veBAL is to support all the initiatives listed above. Aave DAO retains the ability to add to the veBAL position over time as the DAO determines its longer-term strategy.\n\nDetails of events to date can be found below:\n\n- [BAL <> AAVE token swap](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer-part-1/7617)\n- [100k BAL acquisition](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer-part-2/7813)\n\nFor an in-depth overview of the implementation, please see this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/deploy-bal-abal-from-the-collector-contract/9747/8).\n\nAt the time of writing Aave DAO owns 310,485.35 equivalent units of BAL at $4.50 for a total of $1,397,184.08.\n\n- [300,000.000 units](https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) of BAL\n- [10,054.76 units](https://etherscan.io/token/0x272f97b7a56a387ae942350bbc7df5700f8a4576?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) of aBAL\n- [430.59 units](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2516e7b3f76294e03c42aa4c5b5b4dce9c436fb8?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) of aethBAL\n\nA total of 326.88 wETH is to be converted to B-80BAL-20wETH. The wETH is valued at $563,868.00 based upon a $1,725 wETH price.\n\nThe estimated total value of the B-80BAL-20WETH holding is $1,961,052.08.\n\n[1 B-80BAL-20WETH = $12.56](https://etherscan.io/token/0x5c6ee304399dbdb9c8ef030ab642b10820db8f56)\n\nAave DAO can expect to receive approximately 156,134.72 units of B-80BAL-20WETH, minus price impact, etc. This places Aave DAO within the [top 15 B-80BAL-20WETH holders](https://dune.com/balancerlabs/veBAL-Analysis). When converted to veBAL, this is equivalent to 1.63% of the current veBAL supply.\n\n# Specification\n\nWe will be leveraging [Milkman](https://github.com/charlesndalton/milkman) to do a contract-to-contract interaction. This allows the DAO to avoid the need to interact with the CoW Swap API offchain and allows for onchain enforceable dynamic slippage protection. In other words, the trade will execute only if the buy amount is higher than the minimum defined by the Milkman contract instance.\n\nThe highest profile trade to date using Milkman is the [ENS trade](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-3/ep3.3-executable-sell-eth-to-usdc#specification).\n\nThe payload will do the following:\n\n1. Handle approvals and transfers from the Collector contract onto a newly deployed COWTrader.sol contract\n   a. Withdraw aBAL\n   b. Withdraw aEthBAL\n   c. Transfer all BAL now held in Collector to COWTrader.sol\n   d. Transfer specified wETH quantity to COWTrader.sol\n2. The COWTrader contract has one function to execute two trades using Milkman, utilizing its balance of wETH and BAL respectively. Both trades take the held token for B-80-BAL-20-WETH BPT.\n3. Milkman creates a new instance per trade, which will then hold the funds until the trades are settled via CoW Swap. Under the hood, Milkman approves CoW Swap's Settlement contract so it can transfer funds once there is a match.\n4. Once there is a match, the dynamic price checker will protect Aave's funds against a bad quote. If it passes our specified parameters, then the trade will go through and the Collector contract will receive B-80-BAL-20-WETH.\n\nIf everything goes well and the number of tokens to be received matches our parameters (slippage, price against our oracle) then the Collector contract will receive the BPT.\n\nThe trade can remain open in perpetuity until it is canceled or settled. The trade can be cancelled by either Aave Governance or an allowed Llama multi-sig. If cancelled, the tokens are sent automatically back to the collector.\n\n# Implementation\n\nA list of relevant links for this proposal:\n\n- [Governance Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-ethereum-collector-contract/12205)\n- [Test Cases](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2CollectorSwap80BAL20WETH_20230403/AaveV2CollectorSwapTest.t.sol)\n- [Payload Implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2CollectorSwap80BAL20WETH_20230403/AaveV2CollectorSwap80BAL20WETH_20230403_Payload.sol)\n- [Trade Contract](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2CollectorSwap80BAL20WETH_20230403/COWTrader.sol)\n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

If this AIP is approved by the Aave DAO, GHO will become live on Ethereum Mainnet. \n\n\n# Motivation \n## GHO Launch\n\nAfter extensive community discussion, multiple phases of the Aave DAO governance process, and months of testing on Ethereum’s Goerli Testnet, this AIP proposes the introduction of GHO to Ethereum Mainnet with the Aave V3 Facilitator and FlashMinter Facilitator.\n\\\n\\\nFollowing the approval of this AIP, users of Aave V3 on Ethereum will be able to mint GHO against their collateral, kickstarting a new era for the Aave ecosystem and the Aave DAO.\n\\\n\\\nIf approved, the introduction of GHO would make stablecoin borrowing on the Aave Protocol more competitive and generate additional revenue for the Aave DAO by providing to the DAO treasury 100% of the interest payments made on GHO borrows.\n\\\n\\\nFollowing the introduction of GHO, the DAO will also be able to change GHO’s interest rate, as necessary, over time through a governance process. GHO’s financial framework will be managed by the Aave DAO in a decentralized way. \n\n## Facilitators At Launch\n\nGHO introduces the concept of Facilitators. A Facilitator (e.g., a protocol, an entity, etc.) can generate (and burn) GHO tokens up to a certain bucket size. This proposal combined two previously approved Facilitators (the Aave V3 Ethereum Pool and the FlashMinter), and their corresponding initial parameters, into this AIP for approval.\n\n## Aave V3 Ethereum Pool Facilitator\n\nThe Aave V3 Ethereum Pool Facilitator would allow depositors to borrow GHO against their collateral which is deposited in the V3 Ethereum Mainnet Pool.\n\\\n\\\nAfter much community discussion, which can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-genesis-parameters/12151), GHO’s initial parameters for the Aave V3 Ethereum Pool Facilitator passed the following [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb413a17004875443fa3dcf90b07e249b5c4592a760b6daf7b06909131f9fc30c), with 440,000 votes in favour of Option A.\n\\\n\\\nOption A provides the following parameters for the launch of GHO in the Aave V3 Ethereum Pool:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Borrow Rate | 1.5% |\n| Bucket Capacity | 100M GHO |\n| stkAAVE Discount Rate | 30% |\n\n\n\\\nIf this AIP is approved by the community, GHO would launch with the above parameters for this Facilitator.\n\n## FlashMinter Facilitator\n\nAt launch, given community approval, GHO will have a second facilitator as discussed in [this forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-flashminter-facilitator-approval/13092).\n\\\n\\\nFlashMinting provides the same functionality as a Flashloan, but instead of borrowing assets from a pool, users will be able to FlashMint GHO and repay in a single transaction. The FlashMinter would have a beneficial influence on GHO’s ability to maintain its peg because, amongst other benefits, it enables more efficient arbitrage.\n\\\n\\\nThe TEMP CHECK approving the FlashMinter Facilitator and its parameters, with 679,000 votes in support, can be found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x7a2698df2cf35edd4f1739f7657bcf918c8cd3290e1640cba01c3046968a5022).\n\\\n\\\nAs a result of this TEMP CHECK, it is agreed by the community that the FlashMinter Facilitators initial bucket capacity will be 2,000,000 GHO and that there will be no fee paid to the Facilitator. In the early stages, GHO's ability to maintain its peg will be enhanced by low fees, which further incentivizes arbitrage.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal initiates GHO, which consists of a set of actions:\n- Deployment of GHO ERC20 and transfer control over the smart contract to the Aave DAO. \n- Listing of GHO as a borrowable asset in the Aave Protocol. \n- Enrollment of Aave V3 Ethereum Pool as the first Facilitator of GHO. \n- Deployment of GhoFlashMinter and enrollment as the second Facilitator of GHO. \n- Configuration of stkAAVE as discount token for GHO borrow rate.\n\n\\\nIn terms of relevant links, you can find a directory of GHO’s smart contracts [here](https://github.com/aave/gho-core) and all audits of GHO’s codebase, along with audits of the relevant Facilitators, can be found [here](https://docs.gho.xyz/resources). \n\n\n# References\n\n- [Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-mainnet-launch/13574) \n- [GHO Docs](https://docs.gho.xyz) \n- [GHO AIP Repository](https://github.com/aave/gho-aip)  \n- [GHO Payload](https://etherscan.io/address/0x39Bb84eb71dCC1817EA4578377959e2d6841EBB9) \n\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). \n\n",

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP presents the community with the opportunity to add RPL to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRocket Pool is an Ethereum staking protocol. The protocol reduces ETH staking capital and hardware requirements to increase Ethereum’s decentralization and security. Rocket Pool lets customers stake trustlessly to a network of node operators to do this. Adding support for RPL on Ethereum V3 would allow RPL holders to obtain a passive yield on their holdings without the need to deploy mini-pools.\nOn their side, RPL borrowers would be able to participate in Rocket Pool staking without the need to invest in RPL.\n\nRPL is the governance and utility token for RocketPool, a major decentralized liquid staking Token protocol. RocketPool has solidified itself as a Protocol which is actively contributing to Ethereum’s decentralization by making Operating a Node easy and accessible. By supporting RPL on Aave V3 Ethereum we would create an alternative for RPL holders who wish to earn yield on their asset.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: RPL\n\nContract Address: [0xD33526068D116cE69F19A9ee46F0bd304F21A51f](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD33526068D116cE69F19A9ee46F0bd304F21A51f)`\n\n| Parameter                | Value    |\n| ------------------------ | -------- |\n| Isolation Mode           | No       |\n| Borrowable               | Yes      |\n| Collateral Enabled       | No       |\n| Supply Cap (RPL)         | 105,000  |\n| Borrow Cap (RPL)         | 105,000  |\n| Debt Ceiling             | N/A      |\n| LTV                      | N/A      |\n| LT                       | N/A      |\n| Liquidation Bonus        | N/A      |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10%      |\n| Variable Base            | 0.00%    |\n| Variable Slope1          | 8.50%    |\n| Variable Slope2          | 87.00%   |\n| Uoptimal                 | 80.00    |\n| Reserve Factor           | 20.00%   |\n| Stable Borrowing         | Disabled |\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3_Eth_AaveV3ListRPL_20230711/AaveV3_Eth_AaveV3ListRPL_20230711.sol)\n- Tests: [Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3_Eth_AaveV3ListRPL_20230711/AaveV3_Eth_AaveV3ListRPL_20230711.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x036f9ce8b4a9fef0156ccf6b2a205d56d4f23b7ab9a485a16d7c8173cd85a316)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-rpl-to-ethereum-v3/13181)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) and increase Liquidation Bonus (LB) and Reserve Factors (RF) for eleven (11) frozen collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn line with our ongoing commitment to reduce the potential risks associated with V2 markets, we suggest a phased reduction of the _frozen_ V2 markets, comprising low-to-medium cap assets with limited liquidity. The following proposal is the first step to reduce capital efficiency across V2 collateral assets, which will be followed up with more detailed plans for additional parameter updates for these assets.\n\n### LT Reductions\n\nImplementing a gradual decrease in LTs effectively diminishes the borrowing power for the existing markets.\n\n- The community has aligned on the aggressive option, which suggests a LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://chaos-labs.notion.site/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-6-23-338308b47db34c30a92204805f2a1972?pvs=4).\n\n| Asset  | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |\n| BAL    | 70%        | 55%    | $60              | 5                   |\n| BAT    | 70%        | 52%    | $610             | 6                   |\n| CVX    | 45%        | 40%    | 0                | 1                   |\n| DPI    | 70%        | 42%    | 0                | 0                   |\n| ENJ    | 67%        | 60%    | $300             | 4                   |\n| KNC    | 70%        | 1%     | $1,790           | 7                   |\n| MANA   | 75%        | 62%    | $500             | 5                   |\n| REN    | 60%        | 40%    | $1,800           | 6                   |\n| xSUSHI | 65%        | 60%    | 0                | 0                   |\n| YFI    | 65%        | 55%    | $500             | 2                   |\n| ZRX    | 65%        | 45%    | $500             | 5                   |\n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.\n\n### Reduce LTV to zero\n\nLowering the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to zero can potentially curb borrowing by less sophisticated users. It's important to note that due to V2's design, users can bypass the LTV limit to borrow up to the LT value.\n\n### RF Increase\n\nProgressively increasing the reserve factors diminishes the interest rate for providing these assets and lowers the suppliers' incentive to supply the assets. In this proposal, we suggest an initial hike of 10% for all inactive assets.\n\n### LB Increase\n\nWe recommend increasing the LB for all proposed assets (excluding BAL and CVX) to 10% to better incentivize liquidations and accommodate for low liquidity for the given assets.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset  | Cur LT | Rec LT\\* | Current LTV | Rec LTV | Current RF | Rec RF | Current LB | Rec LB |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ----------- | ------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ |\n| BAL    | 70%    | 55%      | 65%         | 0       | 20%        | 30%    | 8%         | 8%     |\n| BAT    | 70%    | 52%      | 65%         | 0       | 20%        | 30%    | 7.5%       | 10%    |\n| CVX    | 45%    | 40%      | 35%         | 0       | 20%        | 30%    | 8.5%       | 8.5%   |\n| DPI    | 70%    | 42%      | 65%         | 0       | 20%        | 30%    | 7.5%       | 10%    |\n| ENJ    | 67%    | 60%      | 60%         | 0       | 20%        | 30%    | 6%         | 10%    |\n| KNC    | 70%    | 1%       | 60%         | 0       | 20%        | 30%    | 10%        | 10%    |\n| MANA   | 75%    | 62%      | 61.5%       | 0       | 35%        | 45%    | 7.5%       | 10%    |\n| REN    | 60%    | 40%      | 55%         | 0       | 20%        | 30%    | 7.5%       | 10%    |\n| xSUSHI | 65%    | 60%      | 50%         | 0       | 35%        | 45%    | 8.5%       | 10%    |\n| YFI    | 65%    | 55%      | 50%         | 0       | 20%        | 30%    | 7.5%       | 10%    |\n| ZRX    | 65%    | 45%      | 55%         | 0       | 20%        | 30%    | 7.5%       | 10%    |\n\n## References\n\n- [Tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2EthRiskParams_20230702/AaveV2EthRiskParams_20230702Test.t.sol)\n- [Payload](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2EthRiskParams_20230702/AaveV2EthRiskParams_20230702.sol)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n# Summary\n\nAdd rETH to Aave v3 Optimism as collateral and to the ETH correlated eMode.\n\n# Motivation\n\nrETH is currently listed on Aave v3 Ethereum and Arbitrum. ETH correlated assets make up over half of Aave's TVL on Optimism. By adding rETH and providing LST diversification, Aave presents itself as a neutral platform offering users the choice between various LSTs.\n\nrETH is listed on Aave v3 Ethereum and has over $58M of deposits. Rocket Pool is expanding its support for rETH across the L2 ecosystem and, recently, a Chainlink oracle was published enabling rETH to be added to Aave Protocol. With the release of this oracle, this publication proposes adding rETH to Aave v3 on Optimism.\n\nLST collateral types drive material borrowing revenue to Aave as users deposit the LST and borrow the corresponding network token. This is most evident on Ethereum where the LST-wETH-yield-maximising loop is the source of the vast majority of wETH borrowing demand.\n\nAn added benefit of offering a variety of LSTs is the respective communities may elect to compete for user acquisition via Aave through offering incentives. This is currently happening on Aave v3 Polygon and Aave’s TVL has meaningfully increased from a relatively small base.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: rETH\n\nContract Address: `Optimism:0x9Bcef72be871e61ED4fBbc7630889beE758eb81D`\n\nrETH/ETH exchange rate: `Optimism: 0x22F3727be377781d1579B7C9222382b21c9d1a8f`\n\n| Parameter                          | Value       |\n| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |\n| Isolation Mode                     | No          |\n| Borrowable                         | Yes         |\n| Collateral Enabled                 | Yes         |\n| Supply Cap                         | 6,000 units |\n| Borrow Cap                         | 720 units   |\n| LTV                                | 67.00%      |\n| LT                                 | 74.00%      |\n| Liquidation Bonus                  | 7.50%       |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee           | 10.00%      |\n| Reserve Factor                     | 15.00%      |\n| Variable Base                      | 0.00%       |\n| Variable Slope 1                   | 7.00%       |\n| Variable Slope 2                   | 300.00%     |\n| Uoptimal                           | 45.00%      |\n| Stable Borrowing                   | Disabled    |\n| Stable Slope 1                     | 13.00%      |\n| Stable Slope 2                     | 300.00%     |\n| Base Stable Rate Offset            | 3.00%       |\n| Stable Rate Excess Offset          | 5.00%       |\n| Optimal Stable to Total Debt Ratio | 20.00%      |\n| Flahloanable                       | Yes         |\n| Siloed Borrowing                   | No          |\n| Borrowed in Isolation              | No          |\n\nOptimism -Ethereum Correlated eMode Category\n\nAdd rETH to Category 2 eMode (ETH correlated)\n\n| Parameter             | Value              |\n| --------------------- | ------------------ |\n| Category              | 2 (ETH Correlated) |\n| Assets                | wstETH, wETH,rETH  |\n| Loan to Value         | 90.00%             |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 93.00%             |\n| Liquidation Bonus     | 1.00%              |\n\n# Implementation\n\nA list of relevant links like for this proposal:\n\n- [Governance Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-reth-aave-v3-optimism/13795)\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb112684943ef900f2918ccbc4de3bb3091869eaeb6b3c15cc26805c17cb6a9f6)\n- [Test Cases](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3Listings_20230710/AaveV3OPListings_20230710_Payload_Test.t.sol)\n- [Payload Implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3Listings_20230710/AaveV3OPListings_20230710_Payload.sol)\n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghosts Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nLlama is a service provider to the Aave DAO and does not receive anything outside of this agreement for the publication of this proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce the Supply and Borrow Caps and Debt Ceiling for MAI on Aave V3 Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn light of MAI's recent depegging and the insights provided in the [Chaos Labs - MAI Depeg Update ](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-mai-depeg-update/14108), we propose a conservative approach, including a temporary reduction in both the supply and borrow caps as well as the debt ceilings. With consideration of the current usage on Aave and existing liquidity, we recommend implementing the following updates:\n\n1. Set supply caps at the current supply in each deployment\n2. Set borrow cap at the current borrow in each deployment\n3. Set Debt Ceiling at 2\\*(Liquidity within LB range / MAI LT)\n\nNote: Final recommendations will be rounded for simplicity\n\n### Recommendations\n\n| Chain    | Current Supply Cap | Recommended Supply Cap | Current Borrow Cap | Recommended Borrow Cap | Current Debt Ceiling ($) | Recommended Debt Ceiling ($) |\n| -------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |\n| Arbitrum | 4,800,000          | 325,000                | 2,400,000          | 250,000                | 1,200,000                | 100,000                      |\n| Optimism | 7,600,000          | 650,000                | 2,500,000          | 525,000                | 1,900,000                | 130,000                      |\n| Polygon  | 2,200,000          | 900,000                | 1,200,000          | 700,000                | 2,000,000                | 180,000                      |\n\nNote: Given the current usage on Polygon, these recommendations effectively disable further usage of MAI as collateral.\n\n## References\n\nTests: [Tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3MAICapsUpdates_20230724/AaveV3MultiMAICapsUpdates_20230724_Test.t.sol)\n\nProposal payload implementations:\n\n[Arbitrum Payload](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3MAICapsUpdates_20230724/AaveV3ArbMAICapsUpdates_20230724.sol)\n\n[Optimism Payload](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3MAICapsUpdates_20230724/AaveV3OptMAICapsUpdates_20230724.sol)\n\n[Polygon Payload](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3MAICapsUpdates_20230724/AaveV3PolMAICapsUpdates_20230724.sol)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The [first reduction](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/255/) in this cycle of LT updates was executed on July 3rd, 2023. Since the initial post proposing to reduce the LTs for CRV, we’ve observed over 12M CRV withdrawn from V2 Ethereum.\n\nIn the Snapshot for this proposal , the community has voted on the \"Aggressive\" option:\n\n1. “Aggressive” (Chaos recommended) - 6% reduction. This option suggests an LT configuration that optimizes the reduction without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation.\n\n_As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step.

This will enable the Metis Foundation to define and fund incentive programs for this Aave pool, promoting growth and expanding the user base of this new Aave V3 market.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Metis Foundation has expressed a desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of the Aave V3 Metis pool. By setting their wallet as the emission manager for the METIS token, the Foundation will be able to directly fund incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity.

As a reminder, FEI has been frozen since [September 2022](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/96/), with the RF set at 99%.\n\nOver the past months, we have witnessed a significant drop in market cap, and together with the recent price fluctuations, we recommend decreasing Aave’s FEI exposure to a minimum.\n\nThe recommended measures include the following:\n\n1. Lowering LT and LTV to zero - This will prevent new borrowings against FEI and potentially further protocol losses should FEI's price fluctuate due to limited liquidity.\n1. By reducing the LT to zero, two additional accounts will become eligible for liquidation, totaling a value of $1,051. The main account to be liquidated can be found [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/wallets/0xa41f03dd427100284ecaa24734b00abc037557c0)\n1. Raising the LB from 6.5% to 10% to provide a stronger incentive for liquidators to address underwater positions.\n1.

      "description": "\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP will update Reserve Factors (RF) on Polygon v2 to encourage users to migrate funds to v3.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith the goal of transitioning users from Polygon v2 to v3, this publication, if implemented, will increase the RF of asset on the v2 deployment.\n\nIncreasing the RF routes a larger portion of the interest paid by users to Aave DAO’s Treasury. User’s funds are not at risk of liquidation and the borrowing rate remains unchanged.\n\nBy progressively increasing the reserve factors, the interest rate for supplying these assets on v2 will be increasingly less attractive, thus encouraging suppliers to transition positions to v3.\n\nOf the assets that are currently frozen, with the exception of BAL, the RF is to be increaed to 99.99%. Around $680k of users positions, CRV, DPI, GHST and LINK will receive near zero deposit yield. This represents less than 0.5% of Aave v2’s TVL. The highest deposit yield of these assets at the time of writing is 0.21%. This change will have minimal affect.\n\nThe remaining assets are to receive an incremental 5% increase in the RF. After implementing this publication, user elasticity shall be assessed and the impact of the updates before moving forward with additional increases.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following parameters are to be updated as follows:\n\n|Asset|Reserve Factor |\n|---|---|\n|DAI|26.00%|\n|USDC|28.00%|\n|USDT|27.00%|\n|wBTC|60.00%|\n|wETH|50.00%|\n|MATIC|46.00%|\n|BAL|37.00%|\n|CRV|99.99%|\n|GHST|99.99%|\n|LINK|99.99%|\n\n\n# Implementation\n\nA list of relevant links like for this proposal:\n\n* [Governance Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-reserve-factor-updates-polygon-aave-v2/13937)\n\n* [Test Cases](https://github.com/defijesus/aave-proposals/blob/reserve-factor-polygon-v2/src/AaveV2PolygonReserveFactorUpdate_20230717/AaveV2PolygonReserveFactorUpdate_20230717.t.sol)\n\n* [Payload Implementation](https://github.com/defijesus/aave-proposals/blob/reserve-factor-polygon-v2/src/AaveV2PolygonReserveFactorUpdate_20230717/AaveV2PolygonReserveFactorUpdate_20230717.sol)\n\n* [Pre-Post Payload Protocol Diff](https://github.com/defijesus/aave-proposals/blob/reserve-factor-polygon-v2/diffs/preTestPolygonReserveFactorUpdate20230717_postTestPolygonReserveFactorUpdate20230717.md)\n\n* [Deployed Contracts](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x812ddad273544754d0672a009c27550899e658aa#code)\n\nThe proposal Payload was reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://bgdlabs.com/).\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe author, TokenLogic, receives payment indirectly from [Aave Grant DAO](https://twitter.com/AaveGrants) via [Butter](https://twitter.com/butterymoney) as part of the [Incentivised Delegate Campaign](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-incentivized-delegate-campaign-3-month/11732).

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes to cancel the Llama streams from the Aave DAO and create reduced rate streams\n\n## Motivation\n\nLlama has historically been a service provider for the Aave DAO and has made numerous contributions. However, during their tenure, there have been several instances where Llama’s performance has fallen short of expectations.\n\nFor instance:\n\nLlama’s handling of the crucial CRV AIP was a clear demonstration of their inability to deliver a much-needed payload in a timely manner. The delay in execution resulted in an additional cost of approximately $1 million for the DAO due to the increased valuation of CRV. This incident underscores the need for service providers who can reliably deliver on their commitments and highlights Llama’s underqualification for the task at hand.\n\nDespite receiving $1.5 million from the DAO, Llama charged third parties for consulting services related to Aave, including teams seeking asset listings.\n\nAs treasury managers, Llama failed to ensure that the collector contract had an adequate aUSDC balance. This oversight resulted in several service providers going unpaid for weeks, tarnishing the DAO’s brand and reputation.\n\nGiven these circumstances, we believe that the most beneficial course of action for the Aave DAO is to end our relationship with Llama. This will allow the DAO to reassess its needs and budget for a new service provider.\n\nfollowing snapshot vote decision, Llama will not be considered as a Service provider for the Aave DAO in the future and will finish its current engagement at a reduced stream \n\n## Specification\n\nThe AIP will call the cancelStream() method of the Ecosystem Reserve and Aave Collector contracts. once that is done, the AIP create two new reduced 57 Days streams. The details are as follows:\n\nEcosystem Reserve Contract: 0x25F2226B597E8F9514B3F68F00f494cF4f286491\nStream: 100001\nAave Collector Contract: 0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c\nStream: 100003\nAddress: 0xb428C6812E53F843185986472bb7c1E25632e0f7\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [Payload](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3LlamaProposal_20230803/AaveV3LlamaProposal_20230803.sol)\n- Tests: [Tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3LlamaProposal_20230803/AaveV3LlamaProposal_20230803_Test.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xceae27bbaf42658a1b46baec664c66c09f9cba4f9452ed2d2bed6f6ce5c66e35)\n- [ARFC Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-cancel-llama-service-provider-stream/14137)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The acquisition aims to support the DeFi ecosystem and position Aave DAO strategically in the Curve wars, benefiting GHO secondary liquidity.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRecent events related to the `0x7a16ff8270133f063aab6c9977183d9e72835428` position on Aave V2 have presented the Aave DAO with an opportunity to support the DeFi ecosystem and make a strategic acquisition of CRV tokens. These tokens can be mobilized to incentivize GHO liquidity via locking them to gather Curve voting power and support a GHO-specific Gauge.\n\nA 2M USDT worth of CRV acquisition would send a strong signal of DeFi supporting DeFi, while allowing the Aave DAO to strategically position itself in the Curve wars, benefiting GHO secondary liquidity.\n\nThe treasury balance and the predicted lower costs for service providers for the 2023-2024 budget would allow this strategic acquisition while maintaining a conservative stance with DAO treasury holdings.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal suggests using 2M aUSDT from the Aave DAO treasury to acquire 5M aCRV tokens from `0x7a16ff8270133f063aab6c9977183d9e72835428`\n\nIn terms of implementation, this AIP initiates a transferFrom() on the aCRV token contract to the Aave Collector, leveraging a previous approval() from `0x7a16ff8270133f063aab6c9977183d9e72835428` of 5M aCRV tokens to the Aave DAO treasury (collector contract).\n\nThen, 2M aUSDT are withdrawn from the collector contract and mobilized to repay part of `0x7a16ff8270133f063aab6c9977183d9e72835428` USDT debt.\n\nIn case of lack of approval on aCRV tokens, the proposal will fail.\n\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2_Eth_CRV_OTC_Deal_20230508/AaveV2_Eth_CRV_OTC_Deal_20230508.sol)\n- Tests: [Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2_Eth_CRV_OTC_Deal_20230508/AaveV2_Eth_CRV_OTC_Deal_20230508.t.sol)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-acquire-crv-with-treasury-usdt/14251)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Since the total supply of MaticX increased since AIP-278, it is possible to increase the supply cap up to 62M while remaining below [75%](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba) of the total supply.\n\nCurrently, the DAO reserve is increasing by ~870 Matic a day thanks to users borrowing Matic, a sizable portion of them are doing so with MaticX token, increasing the MaticX cap would increase the demand for this asset and potentially attract more liquidity for it.\n\nLast but not least, an [incentive program](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632) by the Polygon Foundation is currently running its course on Polygon V3 market, promoting the use of LSD yield leveraging with the MaticX tokens. Thus, this increase would also enhance the synergy with the rest of the ecosystem that is being built around this farming strategy.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following parameters would be modified for the [MaticX](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6) token on the polygon V3 market:\n\n| Parameters | Current  | Proposed | Increase |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Supply Cap | 50.60M | 62M | ~22.5% |\n\nThis would be a bit less than 75% of the current total supply (83.31M)\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [Polygon](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3_Pol_CapsUpdate_20230608/AaveV3_Pol_CapsUpdate_20230608.sol)\n- Tests: [Polygon](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3_Pol_CapsUpdate_20230608/AaveV3_Pol_CapsUpdate_20230608.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot] No snapshot for Direct-to-AIP\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-maticx-supply-cap/14341)\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skyward.\nThe author doesn’t possess MaticX tokens at the time of writing and isn’t paid by the Polygon foundation for this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The first two parts of the plan were successful, driving out liquidity and incentivizing active users to repay their debt and move their position to other stablecoins. The remaining vBUSD debt holders seem to be inactive or unaffected by high rates, due to the time-sensitive nature of BUSD/Paxos situation and the potential risk of protocol bad debt.\n\nThis third part of the offboarding plan will concentrate efforts on creating unsustainable positions for remaining borrowers to either motivate them enough to repay or reach liquidation thresholds.\n\nBoth actions are proposed to be performed:\n\n- Modify risk parameters to “increase” Base interest rate and slope1 curve aggressiveness while decreasing the uOptimal parameter.\n- Remove aBUSD from the collector contract to increase the utilization ratio of BUSD and increase the cost of open positions.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: BUSD (BUSD)\n\nContract Address: 0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53\n\nThe offboarding plan will be carried out With the current AIP with the following parameters:\n\n- Decrease uOptimal from 2% to 1%.\n- reserveFactor remains unchanged at 99.9%.\n- base rate increase from 3 to 100%.\n- slope 1 increase from 7 to 70%.\n- slope 2 remains unchanged at 300%.\n\nWithdrawal of aBUSD from the collector contract. The BUSD will be kept as such in the collector contract, and a separate AIP will organize the swap of BUSD into other assets at a later stage.\n\n## References\n\n- [Tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2EthBUSDIR_20230804/AaveV2EthBUSDIR_20230602Test.t.sol)\n- [proposalCode](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV2EthBUSDIR_20230602/AaveV2EthBUSDIR_20230602.sol)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to increase the supply cap for the wstETH token on the following markets:\n- Arbitrum V3\n- Polygon V3\n- Optimism V3\n\nThis proposal is compatible with the Direct-to-AIP framework.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOn the Arbitrum V3, Optimism V3, and Polygon V3 markets, the utilization of the supply cap reached 77%, 90%, and 100% respectively. Augmenting those caps would allow for a higher TVL  resulting in a better experience for the user of Aave and the ecosystem built around the LSD yield leveraging. This would also increase protocol revenue via more borrowing of WETH on those diverse platforms.\n\nAlong with the utilization of the supply cap, the Total supply of this asset increased as well, which would allow the increase of those caps without compromising on the [75%](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba) of the total supply threshold.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following parameters would be modified for the wstETH token:\n\n| Token | Current supply cap | Proposed supply cap | Increase | Total Supply | Total Supply (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| wstETH Arbitrum V3 | 30k | 45k | 50% | 80k | 56.25% |\n| wstETH Optimism V3 | 23k | 34.5k | 50% | 46k | 75% |\n| wstETH Polygon V3 | 2.7k | 3.45k | ~28% | 4.6k | 75% |\n\nContract:\n- wstETH Arbitrum: [0x5979d7b546e38e414f7e9822514be443a4800529](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x5979d7b546e38e414f7e9822514be443a4800529)\n- wstETH Optimism: [0x1f32b1c2345538c0c6f582fcb022739c4a194ebb](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x1f32b1c2345538c0c6f582fcb022739c4a194ebb)\n- wstETH Polygon: [0x03b54a6e9a984069379fae1a4fc4dbae93b3bccd](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x03b54a6e9a984069379fae1a4fc4dbae93b3bccd)\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [Optimism](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3_Multi_wstETH_CapsIncrease_20230908/AaveV3_Opt_wstETH_CapsIncrease_20230908.sol), [Arbitrum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3_Multi_wstETH_CapsIncrease_20230908/AaveV3_Arb_wstETH_CapsIncrease_20230908.sol), [Polygon](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3_Multi_wstETH_CapsIncrease_20230908/AaveV3_Pol_wstETH_CapsIncrease_20230908.sol)\n- Tests: [Optimism](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3_Multi_wstETH_CapsIncrease_20230908/AaveV3_Opt_wstETH_CapsIncrease_20230908.t.sol), [Arbitrum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3_Multi_wstETH_CapsIncrease_20230908/AaveV3_Arb_wstETH_CapsIncrease_20230908.t.sol), [Polygon](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3_Multi_wstETH_CapsIncrease_20230908/AaveV3_Pol_wstETH_CapsIncrease_20230908.t.sol)\n- Snapshot: No snapshot for Direct-to-AIP\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-supply-cap-increase-wsteth/14376/1)\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis AIP is powered by Skyward.\nThe author doesn’t possess wstETH tokens at the time of writing and isn’t compensated by LIDO for this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The proposed risk parameters for LUSD will mirror those currently in place for USDC on the same pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLUSD is a decentralized stablecoin minted by users of the Liquity Protocol. It has demonstrated its resilience and maintained a stable peg, even in volatile market conditions. By adding LUSD as a collateral asset on the Aave V3 ETH pool, we can offer our users more options for their DeFi activities. Furthermore, the integration of LUSD could potentially synergize with the GHO, enhancing liquidity and further reinforcing the stability of the peg.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed risk parameters for LUSD on the Aave V3 ETH pool are as follows:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV) | 77% |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT) | 80% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 4.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% |\n\nThese parameters are identical to those currently in place for USDC on the Aave V3 ETH pool.\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/20230811_AaveV3_Eth_LUSDCollateralActivation/AaveV3_Ethereum_LUSDCollateralActivation_20230811.sol)\n- Tests: [Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/20230811_AaveV3_Eth_LUSDCollateralActivation/AaveV3_Ethereum_LUSDCollateralActivation_20230811.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x4e17faf4fdb1ea2c8974d19e710724daf98dde225cd2078a9af4fbb5f0895512)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-activate-lusd-as-collateral-on-aave-v3-eth-pool/14199)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is part of the [Skyward](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-skyward-a-free-service-for-aave-dao-by-aave-chan-initiative/13173/13) program, the ACI has not been compensated by any third-party to present this ARFC.\nAt the time of writing, the author does not hold LQTY tokens but owns some LUSD.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to increase the supply cap for the MaticX token from 50.60M units to 62M units as:\n    - Supply cap utilization reached 88%\n    - The MaticX supply increased since the last AIP on the subject\n    - LSD yields leveraging is one of the main sources of revenue for the DAO\n    - An incentive program is currently taking place regarding the above strategy\nIf this proposal gets the green light from at least one service provider it will continue following the Direct-to-AIP framework.\n## Motivation\n\nThe supply caps utilization climbed to 88% recently only a few days after the [last increase](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/278/).\nHistorically supply caps for LSD tokens have quickly been filled up, leading to the implementation of the direct-to-AIP framework, but still, proactivity from the DAO is needed for the smooth experience of the users. Since the total supply of MaticX increased since AIP-278, it is possible to increase the supply cap up to 62M while remaining below [75%](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba) of the total supply.\n\nCurrently, the DAO reserve is increasing by ~870 Matic a day thanks to users borrowing Matic, a sizable portion of them are doing so with MaticX token, increasing the MaticX cap would increase the demand for this asset and potentially attract more liquidity for it.\n\nLast but not least, an [incentive program](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632) by the Polygon Foundation is currently running its course on Polygon V3 market, promoting the use of LSD yield leveraging with the MaticX tokens. Thus, this increase would also enhance the synergy with the rest of the ecosystem that is being built around this farming strategy.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following parameters would be modified for the [MaticX](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6) token on the polygon V3 market:\n\n| Parameters | Current  | Proposed | Increase |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Supply Cap | 50.60M | 62M | ~22.5% |\n\nThis would be a bit less than 75% of the current total supply (83.31M)\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [Polygon](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3_Pol_CapsUpdate_20230608/AaveV3_Pol_CapsUpdate_20230608.sol)\n- Tests: [Polygon](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/AaveV3_Pol_CapsUpdate_20230608/AaveV3_Pol_CapsUpdate_20230608.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot] No snapshot for Direct-to-AIP\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-maticx-supply-cap/14341)\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skyward.\nThe author doesn’t possess MaticX tokens at the time of writing and isn’t paid by the Polygon foundation for this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nChaos Labs proposes an amendment to our current scope of work and compensation structure accordingly. Chaos Labs is currently contracted to cover V3. We propose to formally expand our scope of work to cover all of Aave, including V2 and GHO. Chaos Labs is requesting a $400,000 increase, bringing our total annual compensation to $1.5M.\n\nWe view this expansion of work as an all-encompassing commitment and, with this, take responsibility for all Aave lending markets and financial products for the remainder of the term. Specifically, this means that there will be no further compensation increase requests, regardless of additional deployments, features, or initiatives prioritized during this time.\n\n## Background\n\nChaos’ initial engagement with Aave, starting in November 2022, focused exclusively on risk management and parameter recommendations across V3 markets ([Discussion link](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025)). In early January, prior to the launch of V3 Ethereum, the community approved a 5-month [extension](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/139/) of our engagement to cover V2 markets, which expired in early June 2023. Despite coverage and compensation expiring, Chaos Labs has continued to demonstrate unwavering dedication to managing V2 risk and promoting the transition to V3 while allocating significant resources.\n\nFurthermore, we have committed extensive resources to integrate V2 markets into our product suite and put forward comprehensive analyses and proposals. Given that the transition to V3 is a protracted and ongoing commitment, it remains crucial to maintain proactive risk management for V2 in the transition phase. This necessity was underscored in the recent industry-wide deliberation surrounding the CRV market. Chaos formulated a mitigation strategy now being implemented via a series of governance proposals.\n\nAs risk contributors to the protocol, we at Chaos Labs embrace an all-encompassing perspective. We view our domain of accountability and responsibility as the entire spectrum of Aave, including V2, V3 (all deployments), and the most recent launch of GHO, as they pertain to risk, data science, parameter recommendations, analytics, and more. With this in mind, the amendment to our compensation will more accurately reflect the dedicated resources we allocate, the breadth and depth of our commitment, and the tangible value we provide to Aave.\n\n## **Scope:**\n\nAs outlined in the background section, the scope of our work is expansive, encompassing every element related to market risk throughout the Aave protocol. Below, we highlight the core components of our engagement:\n\n### V2+V3\n\n- **Risk Parameter Optimization** - Deploying our agent-based simulation platform, proprietary methodologies, and a distinguished team of data scientists and researchers, we provide the community with comprehensive analyses and recommendations for risk parameter settings and strategies. Our paramount goal is to optimize protocol revenue while protecting user funds and mitigating potential risk vectors.\n- **Risk Monitoring and Alerting** - We offer real-time monitoring and alerting services through the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). These services allow users to assess ecosystem risk and protocol health at granular levels using dashboards and data visualizations.\n- **Protocol Growth** - We provide integral support to the protocol growth initiatives through detailed market risk assessments and parameter recommendations for new asset listings and deployments.\n- **Incident Response and Ongoing Market Impact Analysis -** We maintain an active role in incident response, ready to react promptly and effectively in the event of any market anomalies or security incidents.

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to onboard sDAI as a collateral-only asset into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool. It outlines the specific parameters for integration and aims to create new synergies with the MakerDAO ecosystem.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe recent increase in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) to 8%—though anticipated to decrease to 5%—presents a unique opportunity for Aave to forge new synergies with the MakerDAO ecosystem. By integrating liquid DSR deposit tokens (sDAI) as a collateral-only asset in the Aave V3 Ethereum pool, Aave can offer users the dual benefit of earning DSR yield while utilizing their assets as collateral. In the context of GHO, this integration would create a yield-generating stablecoin with a higher yield than the GHO borrow cost. It's important to note that this proposal does not conflict with the [DSR integration in aDAI reserve proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-integrating-makerdaos-dsr-into-aave-v3-ethereum-pool/13360), but rather complements it. However, current engineering constraints make immediate integration difficult in the short-term. Should governance approve this proposal, both sDAI and DAI would serve as reserves in the Aave V3 Ethereum pool, with sDAI primarily used as collateral and DAI as a borrowable asset.\n\n## Specification\n\nWe propose the following modifications to the Aave V3 & V2 Ethereum pools:\n\nsDAI contract: 0x83F20F44975D03b1b09e64809B757c47f942BEeA\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| wETH Optimal Ratio on V3 | from 80% to 90% |\n| wETH slope 1 on V3 | from 4.8% to 3.8% |\n| DAI RF on V2 | from 15% to 25% |\n| DAI RF on V3 | from 10% to 20% |\n| DAI optimal ratio on V3 | from 80% to 90% |\n| DAI Slope1 on V3 | from 4% to 5% |\n| DAI optimal ratio on V2 | from 80% to 90% |\n| DAI Slope1 on V2 | from 4% to 5% |\n| DAI stable Borrow | disabled on V2 |\n| sDAI parameters | same as DAI but as collateral only |\n| LTV | 77% |\n| LT | 80% |\n| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/20230816_AaveV3_Eth_SDAIOnboarding/AaveV3_Ethereum_SDAIOnboarding_20230816.sol)\n- Tests: [Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/20230816_AaveV3_Eth_SDAIOnboarding/AaveV3_Ethereum_SDAIOnboarding_20230816.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb41600e3f74bfa520549106fee4d21e7f674c5a79fbf1f7ca16947563474a4d7)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sdai-aave-v3-onboarding/14410)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to fund the operational cost of Aave Robot with LINK tokens from the Aave Collector contract which will help to perform automation on permissionless actions of Aave Governance v2. This proposal also reimburses BGD Labs for the LINK spent previously on the Aave Robot.\n\n## Motivation\n\nGiven the nature of Aave Governance V2, certain permissionless actions such as `queue()`, `cancel()`, and `execute()` need to be called by any address when the conditions are met.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nManual initiation of these actions can result in unnecessary delays and expired proposals, especially when proposers are unaware of additional steps beyond proposal submission. To address these issues, and enhance the overall effectiveness of the Aave Governance, the implementation of the Aave Robot presents a solution leveraging Chainlink Automation to solve it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter a period of testing by BGD Labs, this proposal seeks to fund the operational cost of the Aave Robot to automate key actions within Aave Governance V2, ultimately streamlining processes, and reducing friction.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal will transfer a total of: 1275 aLINK (~ $7500) from the collector contract across Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism networks to the short Executor / Bridge Executor.\nOn the Short Executor / Bridge Executor, the aLINK tokens transferred will be withdrawn to the LINK tokens. In the case of Polygon, as the LINK withdrawn from the pool is not an ERC-677, the payload swaps it one-to-one using `PegSwap` to the ERC-677 LINK token.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOut of all the LINK tokens received, 675 LINK will be used to fund the pre-registered robot using the Aave CL Robot Operator contract by calling the `refillKeeper()` method.\nOnce the keeper is refilled, a total of 600 LINK will be transferred to BGD labs for their previous spending on the Aave Robot for operational expenses.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe `AaveCLRobotOperator` is a contract used to perform admin actions on the Aave Robot. An `AaveCLRobotOperator` is deployed on each network, which will allow for the DAO to have \"admin\" control on all the underlying robots, in order to register new ones, cancel or fund them with the LINK required for execution.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo simplify operational complexity the role of robot guardian will have the permissions to set the maximum gas limit of the keeper and to disable automation for certain governance proposals. This non-invasive role will be held by BGD Labs, as technical service provider engaged with the community.\nInitially, BGD will keep the Robot Guardian role.\n\n## References\n\n- Keeper Contracts: [EthKeeper](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9EEa1Ba822d204077e9f90a92D30432417184587), [PolKeeper](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xDa98B308be8766501ec7Fe3eD9a48EfBD6c31a7B), [OptKeeper](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x102Bf2C03c1901AdBA191457A8c4A4eF18b40029), [ArbKeeper](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x864a6Aa4b8D4d84A7570fE2d0E4eCE8077AbcabB)\n- AaveCLRobotOperator Contracts: [EthOperator](https://etherscan.io/address/0x020e452b463568f55bac6dc5afc8f0b62ea5f0f3), [PolOperator](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x4e8984d11a47ff89cd67c7651ecab6c00a74b4a9), [OptOperator](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4f830bc2ddac99307a3709c85f7533842bda7c63), [ArbOperator](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb0a73671c97bac9ba899cd1a23604fd2278cd02a)\n- Implementation: [Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-governance-v2-robot/blob/main/src/proposal/ProposalPayloadEthereumRobot.sol), [Polygon](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-governance-v2-robot/blob/main/src/proposal/ProposalPayloadPolygonRobot.sol), [Optimism](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-governance-v2-robot/blob/main/src/proposal/ProposalPayloadOptimismRobot.sol), [Arbitrum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-governance-v2-robot/blob/main/src/proposal/ProposalPayloadArbitrumRobot.sol)\n- BGD Robot Guardian: [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0xff37939808EcF199A2D599ef91D699Fb13dab7F7), [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x7683177b05a92e8B169D833718BDF9d0ce809aA9), [Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9867Ce43D2a574a152fE6b134F64c9578ce3cE03), [Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x87dFb794364f2B117C8dbaE29EA622938b3Ce465)\n- Tests: [Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-governance-v2-robot/blob/main/tests/ProposalPayloadEthereumRobot.t.sol), [Polygon](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-governance-v2-robot/blob/main/tests/ProposalPayloadPolygonRobot.t.sol), [Optimism](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-governance-v2-robot/blob/main/tests/ProposalPayloadOptimismRobot.t.sol), [Arbitrum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-governance-v2-robot/blob/main/tests/ProposalPayloadArbitrumRobot.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x763f55d7bc54c4e9699262d44522d16f789d14447815c344a977f0db5f90318b)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-robot-v1/13091/)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nApproval for an engagement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs, focused on development related tasks and with a duration of 6 months.\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAfter a successful Aave <> BGD Phase 1 engagement, this proposal seeks for approval of a new engagement, with narrower scope, duration and budget, in line with the principles of progressive decentralization.\n\nAn extensive rationale and description of this Phase 2 can be found on the [Aave Governance forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-bored-ghosts-developing-phase-2/14484), but for better visibility, these are the key aspects on the scope:\n\n**Development**\n\n- Maintain and improve all the Aave developer-experience tooling introduced in Phase I, including aave-address-book, aave-proposals, aave-helpers, and many others, present in the BGD Github org.\n- Iterate over Aave Seatbelt, making it fully compatible with Aave Governance v3, generalize it more for upcoming networks with Aave instances, and introduce new ideas to improve governance assurance.\n- Lead the development of new items involving changes in the Safety Module. More specifically, those already pre-approved by the community.\n- Create aggregated workflows, by re-organizing repositories (protocol, tooling from BGD, etc). At the moment, there are a lot of developer resources scattered around, properly organizing them requires further work.\n- Development of the killswitch component approved by the community.\n- Maintain and iterate over the upcoming Aave Governance v3, a.DI and Robot systems, including:\n    - Deployment of new voting machines\n    - Support the community on assessment of new bridges, and enabling them via proposals.\n    - Fix any potential problem found.\n    - Maintain the new governance user interface.\n    - Study technical ways of increasing voting participation.\n- Batch a series of improvements for Aave v3, into an Aave v3.1 version: this will include an improvement of the liquidation mechanism, and potentially some periphery components. In addition, any bug fixing (Aave v2 and v3) would be included.\n- Support and advise on deprecation of Aave v2, involving any (reasonable) development. Items included on the Aave v3 part of the scope could potentially be applied on v2.\n- Lead the deployment of 3 new deployment candidates (EVM), apart from the 2 pending network analyses (zkEVM, zkSync), if fully approved by the community. *Extra networks will be evaluated case-by-case*.\n\n\n**Development liaison for security, and quality assurance**\n\n- Plan and coordinate all security resources for any development project of the community, both those executed by BGD and not. This also includes the evaluation of what should be reviewed, the parties involved in it, and asking for a budget to the DAO whenever required.\nIf a major project not executed by BGD appears, we will support it in a best-effort manner.\n- Onboard Certora on governance proposal reviews. We think it is important to have additional expert parties involved in the governance proposals verification process, and healthier for decentralization.\nWe believe Certora, after years of collaboration in the ecosystem, is one of the only entities trustable for the task, if we support them with a light onboarding.\nThis will mean that what previously was done by BGD on the on-chain stage will be taken over by Certora (and included on their upcoming renewal), and is not included/billed in this scope.\n- Act as the main reviewer of submissions on the upcoming Immunefi bug bounty program, pre-approved by the community, respecting the SLA requirements.\n- Keep doing Aave governance proposals’ reviews, on the pre-on-chain stage. We will review all the “operational” projects as they appear (listings, parameters updates), but the timing on ad-hoc bigger projects appearing from other contributors will depend on the project itself.\n- Provide network analysis for 3 new deployment candidates (if applicable), together with tackling the whole deployment and activation technical procedure. *Extra network analysis will be budgeted independently*.\n- Execute an initial iteration of the proposed Aave Forest. At the moment (Phase I) we are finishing the evaluation of an initial set of Owls, but coordination and acting as a technical entity associated “natively” with Aave will be necessary.\n\n**Development support for contributors/partners**\n\n- Support any entity improving the Aave DAO documentation on all technical information.\n- Act as technical point of contact for external partners and contributors of the DAO.\n\n\n**The duration of the engagement is 6 months**, from the execution of this on-chain governance proposal, which acts as the binding agreement between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs.\n\n\n**The budget requested is 1’900’000 USD in stablecoins and 6’000 AAVE, 60% paid upfront and the rest over a stream of 6 months**.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal payload does the following:\n\n1. Releases the upfront payment component to BGD Labs: 1'140'000 aDAI v2 and 3'600 AAVE.\n2. Migrates the aDAI v2 of the Aave Ethereum Collector to aDAI v3, in order to create a stream from Aave v3, following the principles of migration v2->v3 of the community.\n3. Creates 2 streams for 6 months: 760'000 aDAI v3 and 2'400 AAVE.\n\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/20230828_AaveV3_Eth_AaveBGDPhase2/AaveV3_Ethereum_AaveBGDPhase2_20230828.sol)\n- Tests: [Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/blob/main/src/20230828_AaveV3_Eth_AaveBGDPhase2/AaveV3_Ethereum_AaveBGDPhase2_20230828.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xe72dd00eb1ab6223b87e5e1fa740c39b64bfef9b7ccb0939e53403c78a04b18e)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-bored-ghosts-developing-phase-2/14484)\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
