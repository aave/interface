            In Isolation mode you cannot supply other assets as collateral for borrowing. Assets
            used as collateral in Isolation mode can only be borrowed to a specific debt ceiling.

            To exit isolation mode, you will need to repay all your borrowed positions and turn off
            the isolated asset being used as collateral from your dashboard.
